## <a href="#link2" id="link1">28 Strange and Creepy Unsolved Mysteries</a>
1. The disappearance of an extra from Scarface. There's a scene in the movie where Tony and others are upstairs in an apartment while Manny is supposed to keep watch from his car. Manny gets distracted by a blonde girl in a bikini and starts hitting on her. It's a disturbing scene, but there's also an even more disturbing backstory behind something seemingly innocuous: the blonde girl, who was Tami Lynn Leppert. Tami was a Florida beauty queen and model who, near the time of shooting the movie, went to a party and didn't come back the same person. It's like she changed overnight.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229543.jpg">

She became paranoid, began isolating herself, and was convinced someone was trying to kill her. On the fourth day of filming, a character in the movie was shot, and she saw the blood packet get activated. She had a breakdown on set and began to hysterically cry. Tami eventually quit the film and went back home. According to Unsolved Mysteries, her mother claimed there were good and bad days with Tami, but eventually, she snapped and began smashing the windows in their home and attacking family members, fearing they were trying to poison her. Tami went in for a psych eval and showed no signs of drug or alcohol use. The following day, she and her friend went for a drive to the beach, and Tami never came home. The friend told the police they'd gotten into an argument, and Tami wanted to get out of the car, and he let her. She was left near Cocoa Beach, five miles from her home, with no shoes and her purse. She was never seen again.

2. There's a star called "Przybylski’s Star" that's full of plutonium, an element that should not exist anymore in nature as it would have all decayed into other elements.Even if you assume aliens, where did they get so much plutonium? And why would they use it to change the composition of an entire star?Nothing makes sense about it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229535.jpg">

3. The disappearance of Brandon Swanson.He was driving home from a party and drove into a ditch. He called his parents and was on the phone with them as he was unsure of his exact location. He told his parents he was outside of a town and they drove over to pick him up. They were on the phone with him as they were driving, but were unable to locate him. He went silent after saying “Oh s**t” and was never to be seen again.

4. On December 4, 1872, a British-American ship called “the Mary Celeste” was found empty and drifting in the Atlantic. It was found to be seaworthy and with its cargo intact, except for a lifeboat, which it appeared had been boarded in an orderly fashion.No one knows what happened to the crew or why they left the ship.

5. Asha Degree.. lived in my town :( In 2000, she walked out of her home willingly at age 9 in the middle of the night on Valentines Day during a massive storm. She was sighted multiple times walking down an extremely rural and desolate highway by herself in the pouring rain and then was never seen again. Her book bag was discovered miles away buried in a trash bag a year later. How was a 9 year old convinced to leave her home alone in the middle of the night, in a storm, to walk down a deserted highway? How has there been no substantive leads at all since 2001?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229557.jpg">

6. I wanna know about Cicada 3301.Basically in 2012, an image was posted on 4 Chan saying “We are trying to find intelligent individuals for our organization. If you have what it takes the first clue is in this image.” It was an incredibly elaborate puzzle, and solving the puzzle led to another puzzle. And another. And another.These puzzles ended up leading all around the world, in tons of different forms “including the internet, telephone, original music, bootable Linux CDs, digital images, physical paper signs, and pages of unpublished cryptic books written in runes.”

7. I always thought the mysterious green children from Woolpit were interesting. The legend of the green children of Woolpit concerns two children of unusual skin color who reportedly appeared in the village of Woolpit in Suffolk, England, sometime in the 12th century, perhaps during the reign of King Stephen. The children, brother, and sister were of generally normal appearance except for the green color of their skin. They spoke in an unknown language and would eat only raw broad beans. Eventually, they learned to eat other food and lost their green color, but the boy was sickly and died soon after his sister was baptized.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229540.jpg">

The girl adjusted to her new life, but she was considered to be "rather loose and wanton in her conduct". After she learned to speak English, the girl explained that she and her brother had come from a land where the sun never shone. According to one version of the story, she said that everything there was green; according to another, she said it was called Saint Martin's Land. I am assuming the kids suffered from some sort of nutritional deficiency but the story is interesting either way

8. The disappearance of the Anasazi. It’s still baffling how an entire tribe can just completely vanish from the face of the world and only some traces have been found since.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229542.jpg">

9. The gelatinous blobs rained from the sky in Oakville Washington 6 times over a span of three weeks. Not only did no one know where they came from or what they were, but they also discovered the blobs shared similar DNA with humans, and multiple people in the town that had close contact with the blobs reported feeling ill a couple of hours afterward. The Washington State Department took all known samples and somehow misplaced them. edit: the blobs contained similar white blood cells as humans, not similar DNA.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229544.jpg">

10. Tim Molnar. Sends chills down my spine. A young kid from Florida, family-oriented and in college, all the good stuff. One day (in 1984), instead of taking his usual route to school, he decides to drive 50 miles in the opposite direction. He stopped to get gas and continued on. Four months after he had disappeared, his folks received a letter from an auto impound company in Atlanta, Georgia which said that he had left his car in a parking lot six days after he had initially vanished. They also discovered that he had pretty much emptied his bank account just before he left.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229545.jpg">

On January 31, 1996, a show about unsolved mysteries aired, and Tim Molnar was on it. A guy named Steven Cull who had seen it called and told them that he recognized Tim's clothes as the ones he had found on a body frozen in an ice block lot in Neosho, Wisconsin 10 years earlier. Through DNA testing, the body was confirmed to be Tim’s. So tell me: how does this 24-year-old kid who was incredibly close with his family end up 1,300 miles away from his home frozen in an ice block in bumf**k Wisconsin?

11. There was a girl in the 19th century who was murdered after a party. She went to a friends to get dressed, then they went to the party. It was on a particular holiday I don’t remember. She met a man named Thornton at the party and left with him. She was found the next day in a park, she had been r*ped and strangled. Thornton was put on trial but acquitted due to lack of evidence and it was never solved. The weirdest thing was that in the 1970’s it happened again, and both crimes were nearly identical. It was the same holiday, the same town, the girl went to a friend’s to get dressed and they then went to the party. She met a man named Thornton and left with him, and was found the next day r*ped and strangled in the same park, very close to where the first girl was found. Again, Thornton was put on trial but acquitted due to lack of evidence. That story is just weird. Also, both girls had the same birthday.

12. The 'Dog S*icide' bridge, also known as Overtoun Bridge in Scotland. According to VICE, approximately 50 dogs have died by leaping to their death off the 50-foot bridge since the 1950s, and 600 have jumped but survived. Some dogs are even reported to have survived the jump, returned to the bridge, and attempted to jump again.There are tons of theories as to what lures dogs to do this, from the scientific to the paranormal. Some believe the bridge is haunted due to a man throwing his baby off the bridge, believing he was the antichrist. Others think a specific scent is drawing dogs over the edge, such as the smell of mink or squirrels who live under the bridge.

13. The lost A-bomb off the coast of America, which the US government said not to worry about in the 50's and tried to cover up. Was dumped in the ocean in an aviation accident and it's still lost to this day.100x more powerful then what was dropped in Japan.

14.  Probably, Terrence Woods Jr. He was a 26-year-old production assistant on the scene in rural Idaho with his crew filming a documentary about an abandoned mine in late 2018. The project was slated for completion in mid-November but he texted his father early morning on Oct 5th, 2018 telling him that he would be heading home on the 10th of October, cutting his stay short by weeks. Later that day when filming concluded for the day he was seen speaking to one of the miners who used to operate the mine when Terrence said he was going to go into the foliage to relieve himself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229550.jpg">

The Prod Manager thought this was strange because apparently, he had been acting odd all day, so the Prod Manager when to check on him. When he did, he noticed that Terrence's radio was on the ground and suddenly noticed Terrence break into a full-on sprint into the woods down the small ledge. The manager tried to chase him but lost him in the woods shortly after trying. He returned to his crew and alerted the authorities, who launched a full-scale SAR mission that turned up no clues. The authorities noted how odd it was that he was able to run in such thick foliage. He has never been seen nor heard from again.

15. Who was Kaspar Hauser. A feral child found in 1820's germany, who dies a violent death after revealing that he had spent his youth in a darkened cellar.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229552.jpg">

16. Brian Schaffer, a medical student who disappeared from a Columbus OH bar without a trace. There is absolutely no footage of him leaving the bar on the cameras and he has never been heard of since. It seems as if he fell off the face of the earth.

17. The 169th victim of the Oklahoma City bombing. They found an additional leg in the rubble. DNA tests showed it belonged to another victim who had already been buried but with the wrong leg. The wrong leg had already been embalmed, so they could not get DNA at the time. So who did this leg belong to? All other legs had been accounted for in other victims. They found no other body parts, and nobody else had been reported missing. It was only until 2015 they could get DNA from the leg, but it's still classified as a John Doe. A few conspiracy theories had popup like maybe a second bomber that got caught in the blast but it's still unknown.

18. The case of the Somerton Man. This man was found dead on an Australian beach in 1948, and to this day, no one knows who he was or how he died. The case has baffled investigators for over 70 years, and it remains one of the world's most mysterious unsolved cases.

19. The "Wow!" Signal. Astronomers have speculated for years that, if intelligent alien life were real, they would have similar or better understandings of physical sciences as we do. One thing that is universal in chemistry and physical sciences is the frequencies emitted by certain atomic elements. Therefore, intelligent alien life would most likely have an understanding of these frequencies as we do. So, if intelligent life wanted to communicate in a way that was universal between planets (i.e. not a special language or numeric system), then emitting a signal at a certain frequency would be an excellent way of doing that. As hydrogen is the building block of all other elements -- due to its simplicity and integral nature -- astronomers speculate that, if intelligent life wanted to communicate through frequencies, they would do so in the hydrogen frequency.

In the 70's, radio telescopes in the US were pointed up towards the sky collecting any radio data that came in. Most of the data collected are seemingly nothing, just random radio noise. However, in the early morning of August 15, 1977, one of these radio telescope centers began to get a TON of data. And, it was all at or near the frequency of hydrogen. And, the signal was strong and fairly consistent, meaning that it would be incredibly unlikely it was random radio noise or passing radiation. Technicians monitoring the data were dumbfounded by the signal and had no explanation for why it was coming or how it was so consistent. So, they just wrote "Wow!" on the datasheet. We still don't know how such a powerful signal could have even penetrated our atmosphere and remain consistently transmitted for as long as it did.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229560.jpg">

Some people believe it could have been military testing nearby, but, again, it would be incredibly unlikely such a consistent message could be transmitted through simple interference (plus, no military testing was reported in the surrounding area). The same or similar data has not been reported since leading many to believe that the single could have been an "S.O.S." signal from a dying planet or just a passing coincidence that we may never

20.  Houston Tx Lovers Lane Murders. During the summer of 1990, 22-year-old Cheryl Henry met 21-year-old Andy Atkinson through friends at Yucatan Liquor. Andy was home for the summer from Stephen F. Austin State University and the two started dating. On August 22, 1990, the two, who had been dating now for around two weeks, had planned a double date with Cheryl’s younger sister Shane. Each couple went their separate ways to continue the night. Shane said she kissed her sister goodnight and told her “I love you” around 11:30 PM. It was what they always did. But when Shane woke up in the morning, Cheryl still wasn’t home. And over at Andy’s house, he also hadn’t returned home. Both families contacted the police. A search was conducted for the couple and for the car they were in--Andy’s white Honda civic. In the early evening of August 23rd, Houston police located Andy’s car after a guard--who was doing a sweep of an industrial area-- called it in.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229562.jpg">

It was parked in an isolated cul de sac on Enclave Road, an area often used as a Lovers’ Lane. When police approached the car, it was clear something awful had happened. The windows were rolled down. The key was still in the ignition. The seats were laid back and a cassette was in the dash. On the floorboard of the passenger side were a woman’s shoes and purse. But most chillingly, there were fresh signs of blood in the car. Just before midnight, the dogs led police to an area roughly 200 yards from Andy’s car. A golf club and three golf balls seemed to have been purposefully placed, pointing to pieces of a rotting cedar fence on the ground. Police looked under the pieces of fence, and found the body of Cheryl. She was face down. Her clothes had been cut off and tossed near her remains. Her hands were bound behind her back with hemp rope. She had been sexually assaulted and her throat was slashed with three gashes. Near her body was also a twenty-dollar bill. The search continued for Andy. The next morning, about 100 yards from Cheryl’s body in the tree line, authorities discovered Andy’s body.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87229563.jpg">

He was fully clothed with his back against a tree and his hands bound, like Cheryl’s. And like Cheryl, his throat had also been slashed. But the slash was so deep he was nearly decapitated. His watch and money were still on his person, ruling out the possibility of robbery as the primary motive. After 32 years this mystery is still unsolved.
