## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Scariest Horror Movies Based On Real Crimes</a>
1. Psycho – The granddady of real-life horror monsters would have to be Ed Gein, the small town serial killer who partly inspired novelist Robert Bloch to write the novel that eventually became Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157628.jpg">

2. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre – Gein was also a big point of inspiration for the Psycho of the 70s.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157634.jpg">

3. Deranged – Ed Gein once again inspired this 1970s horror film, leading one to wonder if anyone in his family ever tried to sue for royalties.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157624.jpg">

4. The Girl Next Door – Unlike Psycho or TCM, The Girl Next Door hews to a real-life case relatively closely, that of the murder of Sylvia Likens.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157631.jpg">

5. The Strangers – Most home invasion thrillers probably draw from real life at some point, this one in particular was inspired by probably the most famous home-invader of them all: Charles Manson.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157633.jpg">

6. Eaten Alive – Tobe Hooper’s follow-up to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was based on another real-life Texas killer: Joe Ball, aka The Alligator Man.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157625.jpg">

7. Wolf Creek – As frightening as it is, Wolf Creek is indeed based on real crimes committed by Ivan Milat and Bradley John Murdoch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157635.jpg">

8. B.T.K. – Arguably the scariest serial killer of recent vintage is the BTK (short for Bind, Torture, Kill) Killer Dennis Rader, the inspiration for the horror biopic B.T.K.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157622.jpg">

9. Curse of the Zodiac – More respectable films have been inspired by the serial killer known as Zodiac, but this is the grimy horror movie answer to the Fincher movie.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157623.jpg">

10. Gacy – Crimes don’t get much more tailor-made for horror movies than those committed by notorious killer clown John Wayne Gacy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157626.jpg">

11. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer – The crimes and delusional fantasies of Henry Lee Lucas were the primary source of inspiration for this lastingly infamous horror movie.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157627.jpg">

12. The Black Dahlia – Much of Brian De Palma’s 2005 film is devoted to a fictional detective plot, but the case at the center of it all – the still-unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short – is all too real.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157629.jpg">

13. The Dentist – Allegedly based on a real dentist-turned-serial-killer (or is that vice versa?), this is a movie to avoid if you’re already afraid of the dentist.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85157630.jpg">

14. Borderland – Real-life cult leader Adolfo de Jesús Constanzo and the human sacrifices performed by his cult were the inspiration for this 2007 movie.
