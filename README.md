1. "I had an Amiga 2000 HD back in college in the early 90s and was hoping to find a small Amiga to use again. This was advertised as two Amiga 500 computers, a monitor and some accessories so I went and picked it up.  Was surprised that the computers and monitor were boxed. Here is a snap of everything loaded into my car."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361862.jpg">

2. "Starting to sort through the stuff. Came with some boxed games and various discs."

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361868.jpg">

8. "Some more stuff. Two Amiga floppies and a generic external drive. Boxed joystick and a funny 3rd party mouse. Also, two unopened boxes of floppies."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361869.jpg">

9. "WHISPER QUIET LOL"

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361872.jpg">

12. "These were just lose inside the box. I had the second from the right joystick here -- and it sucked. Cramped up my hand after playing for a little while."

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361885.jpg">

25. "Testing it with my Tandy 1000 EX. Works great with CGA. Reading the review from PC Magazine, it also supports EGA and Monochrome. It can support up to 800x560 resolution so I think it might do VGA too. (Will need to make a new cable.)"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361886.jpg">

26. "Hooked up to the first Amiga. Kickstart 1.3. This machine has 1 meg of RAM. Need to check the trap door to see why the clock isn't there."

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361888.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361889.jpg">

29. "Inside, it is super clean. It is very odd that the monitor is quite dim for some reason, even at max brightness. Doesn't appear to have many hours of run-time on it. I adjusted the G1 and G2 controls along with sub brightness and R/G/B cut pots. It made a huge difference now."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361890.jpg">

30. "Trying out some random games it came with. Monitor is looking nice now I adjusted it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361891.jpg">

31. "Even under my bright shop lights it is decently bright. If I turn it up more than this it loses a little sharpness in the center from some minor blooming. Considering the age of this monitor and the unknown history, it's in amazing shape. Not a scratch or nick on it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361892.jpg">

32. "I have the original Deluxe Paint III floppies including the art disc. It was a real nostalgic blast to look at the old classic files like Venus and King Tut."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361893.jpg">

33. "Opening up the computer with the non working clock, it has the Commodore A501 RAM+clock board. It is encased in metal shielding so I cut that away to get inside."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361894.jpg">

34. Yep, here is your problem! Ouch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361895.jpg">

35. "The corrosion ate away a bunch of the copper but luckily it is just ground fill and one trace for the battery which doesn't do anything. I cleaned it as best I could with alcohol and a brush. Hopefully it won't corrode any more."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361896.jpg">

36. "The original battery is a rechargeable NiCD 3.6v -- so the board tries to recharge the battery when powered up. I replaced the battery with a salvaged CR2032 holder and battery and installed a diode to prevent charging of this lithium battery. The clock appears to work perfectly with the 2.9 volts it gets from this CR2032 after diode voltage drop."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361897.jpg">

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">5 of The Most Hated People On The Internet</a>
1. Anita Sarkeesian hosts a channel called "Feminist Frequency". The problem people have with her is her vids contain gross misinformation. The biggest being her post on video games, where she includes a section on "Hitman: Absolution". She argues that games like Hitman cater to sexless nerds by allowing them to beat and murder prostitutes and gain points for hiding or disposing of their bodies. Except Hitman's system deducts points for your killing of innocent people. Sarkeesian also shuts off the comment and rating system for her uploads and began a kickstarter campaign in which she raked in over $160,000 with no word on why she wanted the money or what she plans to do with it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/77662/85329812.jpg">

2. LionMaker is the name of a user specializing in Minecraft vids and other content for children. He has amassed millions of viewers and followers of his content - until the mother of one young Minecraft player reported that LionMaker requested nude photos from her child. LionMaker immediately responded his "account/computer was hacked". The mother did not believe him, seeing as how his Twitter account also included shady messages bragging about sex with a 15-year-old. Then, another 15-year-old boy reported that LionMaker offered him $500 for nude photos. LionMaker now disables all comments and ratings while continuing to post.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/77662/85329815.jpg">

3. These two assholes created a channel involving reaction videos, such as "Kids React", "Teens React", "Old People React", etc. It went all fine until they decided to actually copyright those terms, their format, and even the word "React". This would bar anyone from using those titles or descriptions on their own uploaded videos unless they either paid the Fine brothers 50% for every use or 60% of any ad revenue they earned from their videos. Youtube and Reddit didn't like the idea of two guys attempting to lay claim to words or formats that were around long before their channel existed, so the Fine brothers lost over half of their subscribers and had to issue an apology.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/77662/85329814.jpg">

4. Roosh V and his group promote "neo-masculinity", with his videos espousing hateful views on women, including the idea rape should be legal and female worth should solely be based on fertility or attraction. For a self-proclaimed model of male virtue, he sure is a pussy. All his attempts at meet-ups are quickly canceled, since he and his subscribers become fearful of retaliation and refuse to gather in public.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/77662/85329813.jpg">

5. Martin Shkreli is the king of assholes. He purchased the rights to a drug called Daraprim, used in the treatment of both adult HIV patients and infants. Daraprim was originally $13.50 a script. Thanks to Shkreli, the cost is now $750 a pill. He was arrested on securities fraud, but easily made bail. Then he purchased the rights to Wu Tang Clan's "Once Upon a Time in Shaolin", which pissed off GhostFace Killa. But neither Killa, nor the FDA with Daraprim, can do shit about it. Being called "The Most Hated Man in America" means nothing to Shkreli, as America's deregulation acts protect him. This is what results when you make it legal for rich and greedy individuals to buy literally anything, from others' intellectual content to life-saving medicines and treatments. Shkreli now has a yt channel he uploads to nearly every day to brag about his wealth.
