## <a href="#link4" id="link3">29 Celebrities and What They Were like before They Were Famous</a>
1. Went to middle school with Megan Fox for a bit. She rode my bus and she mostly kept to herself. Most of the guys would fight over who was going to sit next to her but she was very shy and didn't really have much to say.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312263.jpg">

2. I live in the town where Dolly Parton grew up, and practically everyone above the age of 50 who grew up here claims to either be a distant relative of Dolly’s, or they claim to know her in some way. Everyone has their story of the time they met Dolly. It’s pretty obvious, but regardless of who you talk to, Dolly has always been sweet and generous, but everything has simply grown exponentially due to her fame.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312245.jpg">

Examples are the millions of books she gives out for free to children around the globe each month, or how she gave out $10,000 cash to many of my close friends after their houses burned in a fire a couple years back. Thousands of people are employed here and work for one of the businesses she owns, and it’s a tad strange to see when you walk in, but the birthing center at the local hospital is funded by and named after her. I honestly can’t think of one person I know who doesn’t like her. Dolly’s heart has only gotten bigger because of fame.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312246.jpg">

3. I went to school with Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley from Harry Potter). I was into acting too, so we had done a few school plays together. He was really nice, very chill, a good laugh.
I haven't seen him since school days, but he kept coming to classes whenever he wasn't filming, was always happy to chat about the movies. Sometimes he'd need a little break from so many people wanting to talk, and would come and hang out in the library, and honestly, you'd never know he was in the biggest film series at the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312247.jpg">

Honestly, I think a lot of these answers boil down to if they want fame or not. Rupert loved what he was doing, but didn't care about being famous and having people kiss his a**e. Just a nice normal kid.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312248.jpg">

4. A friend of mine is buddies with Paul Rudd. Says he's exactly the same and a great human.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312249.jpg">

5. Jack Black is the same person he was as a teenager, funny, kind, caring, and spreading that joy of music.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312268.jpg">

6. Friend of mine was friends with Tom Hanks in high school and went to prom with him. He still writes her personalized BDay cards on one of his typewriters.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312250.jpg">

7. Chris Evans was really obnoxious as a popular local teenage actor. Imagine his character from Scott Pilgrim but as a kid. He grew up and grew out of being obnoxious and I’m happy for his absurdly successful career.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312251.jpg">

8. My Grandpa (RIP) owned a grocery store in Miami in the late 70s. Wesley Snipes and his friends once stole some candy from his store and when he caught them he let them have it. Since then Wesley and his friends were regulars. Once, Wesley left his bike in front of the store and it got stolen (was a pretty bad area). My grandpa gave him his old bike that he kept in the back of the store. My uncle took over in 2001 when my grandpa died. In 2007 he came back to the store while my uncle and cousin were there, to ask about my grandpa. My uncle said they talked for a little over an hour about how he my grandpa treated him like a son. When he found out my grandpa passed he felt guilty he didn’t visit sooner. He embraced my uncle and cousin and left. My uncle said he told him they plan on having the building repainted while they talked. About a week later a crew of painters arrived and told my uncle they were already paid to have the building repainted. Such a genuine dude.

Edit: Sorry I haven’t been able to reply to everyone, but thank you guys so much for love! Even tho he’s often portrayed negatively, glad to see that people still find try to find the best in us, even it’s a small gesture.

9. Worked in a restaurant about 15 years ago as a manager. Rachel McAdams walked in for an interview. She was still in acting school and serving table to pay for it. She worked at my restaurant over the course of the next 2 summers, serving on our patio. Still friends to this day. She hasnt changed a bit. Still bikes to get groceries.

10. My grandmother worked at Dollywood for many years and met Dolly a handful of times. When she died, Dolly sent two dozen or so roses to the funeral home. She’s a real gem
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312255.jpg">

11. My coworkers dad grew up with Queen Latifah in North Jersey. His whole family loves her because they were about to lose their house, so she paid it off for them. They’ve never said a bad thing about her.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312256.jpg">

(Queen Latifah, if this gets back to you, thanks for what you did for your friends in NJ. Phil’s a really cool guy.)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312257.jpg">

12. My mom used to ride the bus to work in downtown Cleveland with Steve Harvey’s first wife. Apparently she supported him while he was trying to get his career started. And then basically as soon as he got successful he divorced her for a younger woman.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312258.jpg">

My mom always hated him because she felt that he treated his first wife like s**t and always yells “bastard!” at the TV when he pops up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312259.jpg">

13. My dad was good friends with Johnny Depp back in the day. It was around when he was first filming 21 Jump Street (the show, not the movie lol). My dad says he was really humble and kind and always paid their bar tab. Apparently he was quite generous in giving out lots of free quality cocaine at partys too!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312274.jpg">

14. My grandfather taught Jack Nicholson in High School math class. Said he was rebellious but wasn't too bad at math.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312260.jpg">

15. Chris Hemsworth and his brother Liam, both really good blokes before and after they became famous
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312261.jpg">

16. I sat next to Tom Holland while we did our History GCSE, and went to primary school with him so knew him quite well. He was quite often off filming in Thailand for The Impossible at the time. I didn't keep contact with him past GCSE but he was a great guy and very funny, as he seems to be now which is nice to hear.

One memory I do have is a bunch of us laughing at him when he was practising ballet in the school gym getting ready to be Billy Elliott. We weren't laughing for long.

17. I went to college with Joe Keery aka Steve Harrington in Stranger Things. He was my college boyfriend’s suite mate and just the nicest guy. His hair has always been dreamy and amazing. Last time I saw him was at a viewing of the Hateful Eight after we graduated and he still made a point to come over and say hi!

18. I went to school with Emily Ratajkowski. She’s always been kind and really smart and genuinely talented. Worst I can say is in middle school she auditioned for a play and she didn’t get the part she wanted so she didn’t do the play at all. I got the part she refused, lol. I ran into her when we were in college (still before she got famous) and she seemed sincerely happy to see me and catch up, I remember she loved the coat I was wearing. IMO her interviews and ‘famous persona’ are authentic - she is a legit badass babe. I’m super proud of her.

19. I knew Robert Pattinson about 15 years ago. Nice guy, friendly, a lot of fun to be with. He lived by himself in the centre of Soho, London, in a tiny one-bed flat that I think he felt like the romantic vision of a starving artist, or at least wanted to.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312269.jpg">

He had a weird side. He'd say random, violent, depraved things. He was obsessed with Jack Nicholson. He never really gave a f**k, he had confidence and he was always himself, and he knew he could be deliberately contradictory and he used that as a personality trope. But he was a good guy, and I get the impression he's very comfortable with himself now that he has developed his career, that he acts very well, and that he can pick and choose his roles based upon what he wants to do and who he wants to work with.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312270.jpg">

Twilight for him was always a means to an end, and I think he worked it very much to his benefit, and didn't compromise himself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312271.jpg">

20. A close family friend was best friends with Tom Cruise before he got famous. I didn’t believe her and she showed me pictures they have taken together like a Vegas road trip, camping, etc. He was really awesome but as soon as he got an ounce of fame it went to his head and he became very arrogant and a fame w***e
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87312272.jpg">

21. Tyler the Creator - Exactly the same. We were all concerned at how bizarre he was. He would call people “a table” or something incredibly random and the sense of humor caught on in my high school. The fame did nothing, he’s still strange and a sweetheart.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">25 Strangest Things about Gandhi</a>
1. In 1948, Gandhi's killer was immediately apprehended by an American diplomat, Herbert Reiner Jr. The diplomat had hoped to meet Gandhi for the first time when the murder occurred.

2. Mahatma Gandhi wrote two letters to Hitler, in which he asked him to stop the war cause it would have caused many victims. Neither of the letters he wrote was allowed to be sent by the colonial government.

3. In 2003, MTV aired an adult cartoon called Clone High which features clones of historical figures in high school. It was canceled after one season because it caused mass protest in India and even hunger strikes over its portrayal of Gandhi as a party animal.

8. Gandhi never said "Be the change you wish to see" what he said was much more eloquent:

“If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. ... We need not wait to see what others do.”

9. Mahatama Gandhi modeled his Dandi march on the Boston Tea Party. He always quoted about the American struggle for independence in his speeches. He even flavored his tea with salt, while signing Gandhi Irwin Pact to commemorate the influence of Boston Tea Party in his satyagraha.
