## <a href="#link4" id="link3">15 Of The Most Dangerous Gangs In The World </a>
1. Otherwise known as the American Mafia, Cosa Nostra is an extension of the Sicilian Mafia. Highly organized, but extremely violent, Cosa Nostra engages in acts of murder, drug trafficking, loan sharking, and other crimes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166633.png">

2. Los Zetas is one of the most powerful drug organizations on the globe. According to the U.S. government, Los Zetas is “the most technologically advanced, sophisticated, vicious, ruthlessly violent and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166634.png">

3. The Aryan Brotherhood is a white supremacist gang that requires you to kill or assault a fellow prisoner if you want a chance at joining. It’s a gang that you’re in for life- if you try to leave, you either end up in a hospital or in a coffin. The gang is so violent that it is responsible for approximately 1/4 of American prison murders.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166635.png">

4. One of America’s most famous gangs, the Crips are known for wearing blue while carrying out extreme acts of violence. A lot of their casualties actually come from internal conflicts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166637.jpg">

5. Bloods, Just like the Crips, they are known for their violence and flashing their gang colour, which in this case, is red. Originally, they were a faction of the Crips. But when they broke off into their own gang, they had to resort to extreme acts of violence due to the fact that they were outnumbered 3:1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166636.png">

6. 18th Street Gang.These guys are extremely violent. So violent, in fact, that not only is one person assaulted per day on average by an 18th Street gang member in L.A., but their kill count is over 3 times as high as their main rivals.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166638.png">

7. Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC).This gang can be found all throughout the prison systems of Sao Paolo, as well as the favela slums. They use fear to control their territories, and commit crimes such as kidnapping, extortion, and murder. In 2006, the entire city of Sao Paolo was under siege by the gang for nearly a week as the PCC killed police officers and burned down government buildings.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166639.png">

8. Triads.  This Chinese crime syndicate consists of over 2 and a half million members worldwide. Each branch lives by it’s own individual set of customs and rules, but they are all known for their violence and drug trafficking.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166640.png">

9. The Hell’s Angels is probably the most well known biker gang in the world. Police have them classified as one of the “Big Four” bike gangs, and say that they are involved in extortion, prostitution, drug trafficking, and extreme acts of violence.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166641.jpg">

10. Latin Kings.Widely considered to be the largest and most well-run Latin gang in the world, the Latin Kings are highly organized and even practice forms of Marxism, Confucianism and Christianity. Don’t be fooled though, they’re dangerous as shit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166642.png">

11. When you join the Yakuza, you’re required to cut all ties from your family. Allegiance to the leader is #1 in the Yakuza. Members are usually heavily tattooed, which is why tattoos are sill considered somewhat taboo in Japan.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166643.jpg">

12. The rival of the Hell’s Angel’s, the Mongols are involved in the same activities and are often involved in violent. bloody clashes with them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166644.png">

13. Irish Republican Army (IRA).The IRA has been involved in plenty of terrorist attacks and deaths in an attempt to eradicate Northern Ireland.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166645.jpg">

14. The Russian Mob is known for their involvement in Human trafficking, racketeering, drug trafficking, extortion, murder…the list goes on. These guys are not afraid to kill their own family if they have to.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166646.png">

15. Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13).With over 70,000 members, MS-13 is considered by many to be the most violent gang in the world. They literally do not give a shit who they have to kill in order to instill fear. They’re known for their random acts of violence and even stoop as low as to kill innocent women and children.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Disturbing Mysteries That Remain Unsolved</a>
1. Honestly the Cape Intruder isn't disturbing just weird as hell. During the night in Cape, Maine in like 2005 people who kept their doors unlocked would wake up to find a man staring at them and he would quickly flee. No people were ever injured and nothing was ever stolen. He just watched people sleep apparently. -whatislife40

2. The Axeman of New Orleans. Guy was murdering people but wrote a letter that he wouldn't kill anyone who played jazz in their home/business. Never caught. -BlueFalconPunch
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112228/87289629/axeman.jpg">

3. West Mesa Bone Collector. Ok this one is extremely creepy- 12 women and girls identified, with the final victim being only 15. Satellite images show the final body was buried in 2005. The police release photos of women that appear to be sleeping or incapacitated saying they are of interest to the case but don’t explain how. -Temporary-Sundae2471
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112303/87289642/westmesa.jpg">

4. The Hinterkaifeck murders always freaked me out. I've read quite a bit about it, and it sounds like it was probably a neighbor. But the creepy part is that the killer was probably living/hiding out in the attic for multiple days beforehand. -TecateLanding
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112250/87289636/hinterkaif.jpg">

5. The disappearance of the Beaumont Children The Beaumont Children are siblings who disappeared in 1966, in Australia. There are still to this day investigations on going to try and find the remains of these children. There have been foundations of sheds and houses dug up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112231/87289630/BeaumontChildren.jpg">

The children have never been found and the suspect(s) has never been identified. -jnrdingo
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112220/87289627/alissaturney.jpg">

6. Technically not unsolved since everyone can guess what happened to her but it’s one of the creepiest IMO. Alissa Turney was a teenager who disappeared in 2001. Her stepfather, Michael Turney, was obsessed with her. He stalked her at work, and put cameras in the vents to spy on her. Michael picked her up from school early on May 17, 2001 and she’s never been seen since. -meyganvibes
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112244/87289633/brandonswanson.jpg">

7. The disappearance of Brandon Swanson. It's a lengthy case so I won't summarize here, but he went missing while on the phone with his parents, his last known words being "Oh shit" before the line went dead. Not a trace of him has ever been found. -bubble0peach
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112223/87289628/alicianavarro.jpg">

8. Alicia Navarro. She went missing, presumably after sneaking out to meet with a man she was talking to on Discord.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112232/87289631/betsyaardmas.jpg">

It's creepy because of how real it is. As a naive girl who met up with guys I befriended online as a teenager, I just cannot stop thinking about how goddamn lucky I was. -meladey
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112237/87289632/brianschaffer.jpg">

9. Murder of Betsy Aardsma. In 1969, Betsy, a student was killed in the stacks of the library at my old college (Penn State) and was found with a singular stab wound on her chest. It wasn’t even late or anything, and while there were many suspects, no one was ever arrested for it. It’s insane how someone could kill a person in broad daylight at a major university, and get away with it. -Rickdaquickk
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112248/87289634/ashadegree.jpg">

10. Brian Shaffer, who went missing from Columbus, Ohio. He was reported missing after a night out. There's security camera footage of him entering a bar, but absolutely no footage of him leaving. Like he went into the bar and just flat out dropped off the face of the earth. The last I knew, he's never been found and nobody knows what happened to him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112249/87289635/flight370.jpg">

The bar was on a second floor at that time with only one public entrance/exit. The police extensively reviewed all the security camera footage. Brian and everyone else who was there that night was seen on camera entering the bar. Everyone, except for Brian, who was at the bar that night was seen on camera leaving the bar. Which would nix any theories that he left wearing different clothes/disguised as someone else/mixed in with a crowd. -RedRose_812
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112256/87289639/missybevers.jpg">

11. Asha Degree. There’s so many weird things about the case to me. She went missing on her parent’s anniversary, she ran into the woods when approached, and likely left home in her pajamas. It feels like she left on her own, I just can’t begin to imagine why. -chesterlola2014
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112300/87289640/kyronhorman.jpg">

12. Flight 370 Malaysia Airlines. Disappeared without a trace. -ignaciodib
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112251/87289638/iowapaperboys.jpg">

13. Missy Bevers. A suspect in full SWAT armor breaks into a church and smashes windows and breaks opens doors with a hammer, looking for a local fitness instructor. They then find and beat her to death before getting away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112312/87289646/zebbquinn.jpg">

There is high quality surveillance video of both them and their car, but investigators couldn't make out the license plate. There has been a suspect who was cleared because of an alibi, and there's been no recent updates. -wedoabitoftrolling
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112300/87289641/sodder.png">

14. Kyron Horman. I feel like somebody knows something that will blow the case wide open but to this day nobody knows where he went or what happened to him. There are some solid theories out there but it’ll always be a mystery until we get an official answer. -candycrunch1
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112304/87289643/theislandofeileanmor.jpg">

15. In the early 80s, all within 18 months of each other, three paperboys in the Des Moines, IA area all went missing during their morning route. The cases have never been solved. There are theories an ex-employee who was a creeper kidnapped them, and even a lone wolf type situation. It's a bizarre case that has baffled Iowa for years. -deleted
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112306/87289644/yogurtshop.jpg">

16. The disappearance of Zebb Quinn. He was 18 years old when he went missing in 2000. He was working his shift at a local Walmart and afterwards wanted to look at a new car with a colleague, when he allegedly received a call that made him take off frantically. After that he was never seen again.
