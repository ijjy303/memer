2. Hard work isn’t always the answer.
When I worked a minimum wage job, I would work hard and not take breaks, so a great job, and always finish early. I just then got told to pick up the slack for the employees who spent their time goofing off. Never got a promotion, raise, or even a “Hey, good job”

3. Just because I hold an opinion on something doesn't mean that I need to share it. I spent WAY too much of my early adulthood inserting my viewpoint into discussions that I wasn't really a part of.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271310.jpg">

11. Sometimes regardless of how good a person you are, how hard you try, and how sincere you feel. There are people who will mistreat and take advantage of you. And more importantly, them doing that usually isn’t your fault. It’s more often a product of who they are and wasn’t as personal or important of a choice for them as it will feel for you.
 
-u/BookOf_Eli
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271317.png">

12. Percentages are reversible. So 8% of 25 is the same thing as 25% of 8 and sometimes the reverse is easier to calculate.
 
-u/CheekyOnion64
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271318.jpg">

14. Bit late to this but a university lecturer once said "Practice doesn't make perfect, it makes permanent."

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87271327.jpg">

22. That you need to regularly check and top up the fluids in your car. I bought my first car at 16, a cheap old beater, and knew nothing about cars other than gas makes it go.
