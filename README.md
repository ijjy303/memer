## <a href="#link6" id="link5">Conor McGregor Trolls Floyd Mayweather With A Custom Made F-U Suit</a>
1. Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor finally met face to face in the first press conferences before their big August 26th fight. The event was full of taunts by McGregor, saying he'd knock Floyd out within the first four rounds, and calling Mayweather old, but the real message was McGregor's suit, which was much quieter.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85405853.jpg">

2. McGregoer's suit, like much of everything Mcgregor does, was a promotion for his up and coming line of suits. Part-troll, part businessman, McGregor used his face to face with Mayweather to both, get into his opponent's head and to get into our pockets.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85405852.jpg">

3. If McGregor fights with half the skill he uses to troll, then Mayweather doesn't stand a chance.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">17 Of History's Greatest Hoaxes and Deceptions</a>
1. In the 1700s, a woman named Mary Toft in England tricked doctors into thinking she could give birth to rabbits. Sometime later she admitted that she shoved rabbits into her vagina before 'birthing' them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311024.jpg">

2. In 1906, a German shoemaker, Wilhelm Voigt, impersonated a military officer and tricked a group of soldiers into helping him rob a small town. The German Emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm II thought it was so funny that he personally pardoned Voigt.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311025.jpg">

3. In 2004, a German hacker named Axel Gembe stole the source code for Half Life 2. Gabe Newell, the managing director of the company then tricked him into thinking Valve wanted to hire him as an "in-house security auditor." He was given plane tickets to the USA and was to be arrested on arrival by the FBI. German government became aware of his plan and he was arrested in Germany and put on trial there.

4. The "Cottingley Fairies" were captured in a series of photographs by two young cousins Elsie Wright and Frances Griffiths in 1917.  The images were an instant sensation, even fooling Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of psychic phenomena. It wasn't until 1983 that the two girl finally admitted that they faked the photos using cardboard cutouts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311028.jpg">

5. In 1968, a car driven by Japanese bank employees was pulled over by a motorcycle cop claiming that the car had been rigged with a bomb. The cop got under the car to "defuse" the device. When the car started to smoke, everybody ran. Then the "cop" just drove the car away. This 300 million Yen robbery still remains unsolved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311029.jpg">

6. The "Spaghetti Tree" hoax was an April Fools prank played by BBC in 1957 when they aired a short TV segment about the harvesting of spaghetti trees in Switzerland. At the time, not everybody knew how pasta was made, so a spaghetti orchard seemed very plausible. About 8 million people watched the broadcast, which CNN later called "the biggest hoax that any reputable news establishment ever pulled."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311030.jpg">

7. Someone tricked a Nigerian scammer into hand writing an entire Harry Potter novel, the whole 293 pages and scanned with a scan width of 1200 pixel. They told them that they are too busy with writing down printed books by hand to help the scammer, and offered to pay him $100 per page if he was willing to work for them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311031.jpg">

8. The reverse scam on the Nigerian scammer was topped by someone else tricking a different group of Nigerian email scammers into recreating Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketch.

9. In the 2004 Harvard-Yale game, Yale students tricked thousands of Harvard fans into holding up cards that together spelled out "WE SUCK."

10. In 1725, professor Johann Beringer was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at University of Wurzburg in what is now Germany. Also, he was apparently an insufferable coworker, which is why two of his colleagues decided to plant fake fossils in places Beringer was known to dig.  Thousands of stones planted over a series of months bearing images of plants, animals, Hebrew symbols, religious iconography, etc... When Beringer was about to publish a book on his findings, his colleagues finally admitted the prank, but by then it was too late. He figured they were just jealous, and published the book anyway. In the end, it would ruin all three of their careers.

11. In 1998, a Japanese comedian was tricked into a real-life "Truman show" when he accepted a job which (unbeknownst to him) would lock him into an apartment, naked and cut off from everything and film him, without knowledge.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165744/85311036.jpg">

12. The inventor of the Brazen Bull, Perillos of Athens, was tricked into being the first victim of his sadistic execution device.

13. A man protested against the 1956 Olympic torch relay by carrying a fake flame, consisting of a pair of underpants set on fire in a plum pudding can, attached to a silver painted chair leg. He tricked onlookers and even handed it to the Mayor of Sydney, Pat Hills before escaping without being noticed. The prankster, Barry Larkin, and the other 8 students performed the prank in protest of the torch relay which had been invented by the Nazis.
