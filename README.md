## <a href="#link10" id="link9">20 Dark Secrets People Are More Comfortable Telling Strangers Online Than Their Family</a>
1. My grandma was in a car accident and broke her ankle so she stayed at my house and we took care of her while she recovered. I was entering puberty at the time and discovered that you could order porn on cable and was like a madman ordering porn.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112134/87319154/cable.jpg">

The bill that month came out to $500 my mom thought it was my grandma because her novelas were on like channel 50-60 and the porn was 500-600 lmfaoooo. I’ve literally never told anyone to this day. -pinchefresona
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112130/87319153/camaro.jpg">

2. My uncle owned an old Camaro that collected dust in his garage. When I was around 10 my family and I were in town visiting and I wrote the word “fuck” in the dust on the hood of the car. I used my thumb so that the letters were fatter than my normal index finger. A few hours later my aunt/uncle asked us who did it and I “proved” it wasn’t me by showing how the person who did it had bigger fingers than me. Taking that shit to my grave! -CLToris
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112141/87319155/college.jpg">

3. That I didn't graduate from college. I failed one course my senior year, 2nd semester. The ceremony was already set up so they let everyone walk. I had no diploma in my award...nobody knows to this day and it's been 17 years. Failed one course, 3 credits. Was ashamed so I never went back for those 3 credits. So everyone believes I graduated. -TheLargeYard

4. I owe the bank $100k. -markoshenov
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112117/87319150/abortion.jpg">

5. It's not my secret, but my mom's. And I'm not hiding it from everyone, just the person who it potentially matters to the most. When my mom was in high school in the 60s, she had a long-term serious boyfriend named Jimmy. They were each other's first, they were together for years, and were planning on getting married. He went away to college, my mom stayed behind, but they were still together. You know what happened next. He cheated and got the new girl pregnant. He comes home to break the news to my mom. Abortion was not legal at the time. He basically says that he wants to be with my mom, but he has no choice but to marry this other girl. My mom was devastated.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112129/87319152/callme.jpg">

Here's the secret: my mom was also pregnant by him, but hadn't told him yet. She decided she wasn't ever going to tell him. Jimmy went on to marry the other girl and never knew my mom was also pregnant. She told me that she later threw herself down a flight of stairs to cause a miscarriage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112142/87319156/churchpoop.jpg">

My mom actually reconnected with Jimmy during the early days of Facebook. She didn't have an account, but asked me to look for him using mine. He was still married to the same person. My mom was married to my dad. They wrote to each other for a while (using my account! ugh!) Signed their messages saying "I Love You."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112144/87319157/elevator.jpg">

My mom passed away a number of years ago. I think about this knowledge I have that Jimmy doesn't. This major life event thing that he doesn't even know happened. That could have changed the trajectory of many lives. I'm certainly not going to tell him. It's not my secret to tell. -kbivs

10. My grandpa was stationed in Okinawa, Japan during the Korean war, while in the Marines. He hooked up with a woman there, and she got pregnant. So, I have a Japanese aunt and a few cousins, in Japan, whom I’ve never met before. -Cardinal270
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112204/87319163/notmarried.jpg">

11. Funny, light hearted story from my childhood. My little brother was in the shower, I could hear him singing. I put a coat on backwards, and a stocking cap pulled over my face, and waited outside the bathroom door. He opened the door (still singing, and dancing kinda), and I did the Frankenstein thing. Arms out, moaning “uhhhh”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112215/87319167/pornsite.jpg">

He screamed and fell backwards knocking the toilet completely over. Water went everywhere, the top of the toilet tank broke, shower curtain ripped down, and him laying on the floor in the middle of all this. I ran back down the hall; coat and hat off, and sauntered back casually. By then my mother and father and our sisters were there, and everyone is like, you know, what the hell. I’ve heard him tell this story as proof of the existence of ghosts. To this day (little feller is now a 52 year old bank manager with two kids)he believes in ghosts. I don’t feel a bit bad. -Jimmysweetspot

12. My wife is handicapped and I lied to her that I find it hard to clean/cut up mushrooms. She has self esteem issues because I can do things much easily than her. So I lied, and now she feels better. -bukake_attack
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112211/87319165/pest.jpg">

13. One of my closest co-workers, who is an integral part to our very large corporation killed a man in his late teens and threw the body in a lake. He only got off on a technicality. I work remotely so I don’t build a lot of personal relationships with people I work with regularly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112212/87319166/parenting.jpg">

I googled his full name. It freaked me out at first. But I’ve kinda gotten over it. I wonder if anyone else knows. It happened 40+ years ago. He will retire soon and then I might ask another co-worker about it. I just don’t want to stir the pot. -adamsfan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112219/87319168/plans.jpg">

14. My wife and I aren't officially married. No one knows. We had a ceremony and everything, reception... the whole nine yards. We just never did the official paperwork.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">Guy Leaves His Apartment During Construction and Comes Back to Gigantic Mess</a>
1. About 4 weeks ago I got a notice that there would be some construction work done in the apartment I live in. I got a letter telling me that the construction workers will need access to all apartments on saturday, June 24th and monday, June 26th. My landlord collected all security keys, so the workers could access the apartments in the event that nobody is there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85392998.png">

So I made the dumbest mistake I could make: I left my apartment. This is the picture I took about 5 days prior, June 19th. It shows my shelf the way I left it before I left my apartment, I don't really touch the game wall because I have no reason to. I'm more of a collector than an active gamer, and once I finished something, I put it in my shelf for it to look good. I want to point out the Majoras Mask 3DS, which is worth around 300-500€."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85392999.jpg">

2. I left my apartment on Saturday at 12:40 pm  because all the construction noise was getting on my nerves.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85393000.jpg">

I briefly returned the next day, Sunday, to get some things, when I noticed something weird about my shelf. Something was missing. I was joking around with my boyfriend that they'll probably rob me, I didn't actually believe they would.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85393001.jpg">

They handpicked a single game from my collection, probably thinking I wouldn't notice it. They targeted GTAV before, because they swapped places with REZ Infinite - too bad for them that it was an empty box. But Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 seemed to do the job just fine, given it was still wrapped and unopened since I bought it.
