## <a href="#link1" id="link0">This Guy Trolled Thousands Of People With Two Photos</a>
1. When this guy posted this photo people were wondering what is in the red circle. Some of them even claimed to see a wolfish shape.

2. The next photo caused some to write: "I'm never going in the woods again."

3. When this photo revealed everyone got trolled they got furious. Things got heated, bad language and insults were posted. Here are some comments- "Oh you fucker I was staring at my screen like an idiot", "I hate you", "I fucking zoomed in so hard. My eyes hurt from squinting", "I was even staring at that last picture for a bit". Well played Wood Troll, well played.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">16 People Arrested for Dumb Social Media Posts</a>
1. Escaped Prisoner Gets Caught at Mexican Resort: 

A fugitive who escaped from the Payette County jail in Idaho was arrested by U.S. marshals after he posted his whereabouts on Instagram. They nabbed Nicholas Grove, who escaped by scaling a fence in 2014, in Tulum, Mexico, thanks in large part to the selfies he posted at a resort.

"Social media certainly played a role originally because this particular individual bragged about his escape on Facebook," Marshal Brian Underwood said. It's a good lesson from criminals and non-criminals alike: Keep your vacation photos to yourself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947153.jpg">

2. Tourists Ruin Historic Landmark For Instagram Post:
 
Two American girls, aged 21 and 25, broke off from their tour group while on vacation in Rome, Italy and decided to use a coin to carve their initials into the walls of a structure that was built just slightly more than 2000 years before the dawn of social media.
Other tourists in the historic landmark reported the vandalism to guards and the pair were arrested for aggravated damage to a building of historical and artistic interest. The girls could see a fine of up to 20,000 Euros as a similar fine was imposed upon a Russian tourist who vandalized the structure about a year before.
No word on how many likes the selfie received.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947154.jpg">

3. Teen Sends Murder Scene Selfie Via Snapchat: Snapchatting a selfie with you and your victim is the perfect way to share a crime scene photo, right? Seven seconds of revelry and then the evidence disappears. Until the person on the receiving end snaps a screen shot with your user name on full display, of course.
Maxwell Marion Morton (no relation to Matron Mama) was charged with first-degree murder in Pennsylvania after he sent a Snapchat of himself and his victim (16-year-old Ryan Mangan) to several people, one of whom took a screenshot of the (perhaps) unintentional confession.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947155.jpg">

4. Dutch Girl Arrested for American Airlines Threat: "Hello my name's Ibrahim and I'm from Afghanistan. I'm part of Al Qaida and on June 1st I'm going to do something really big bye." was the tweet sent by 14-year-old Sarah, @QueenDemetriax_ on Twitter, in April 2014, supposedly as a joke. The folks over at @AmericanAir however were not laughing and quickly responded by saying, "@QueenDemetriax_ Sarah, we take these threats very seriously. Your IP address and details will be forwarded to security and the FBI."
What followed, before the account was suspended, was the complete implosion of the so-called joke and an insane freak out by the Dutch teen. After pleading that she's "just a girl" and vowing not to tell her parents about her momentary lapse in sanity, Sarah later turned herself into police where she was charged with posting a false or alarming announcement.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947156.jpg">

5. In The "You're Old Enough To Know Better" Category: Back in May 2010, then-26-year-old Paul Chambers tweeted about his intention to blow Robin Hood Airport "sky high" if his upcoming flight at the British airport was late. What he didn't account for was the chance that he'd miss said flight because he'd be arrested for that tweet two days before his scheduled departure.

Claiming the tweet was an "innocuous hyperbole," Chambers fought the legal charges, which included sending an offensive, indecent, obscene, or menacing message over a public telecommunications network, and lost, something that cost him 1,000 pounds and his job at a car distribution firm. His whining continued on Twitter with tweets talking about how this punishment does not fit the "crime" and complaining that this has jeopardized his career. Clearly, he learned nothing from the incident.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947157.jpg">

6. Man Repeatedly Tweets About Assassinating President Obama: There are many things that would really be common sense that would be really, really bad to tweet about. Assassinating the president lands squarely in that category. So it should be no surprise that in September 2012, when 21-year-old Donte Jamar Sims posted a series of tweets talking about killing President Barack Obama with "that Lee Harvey Oswald swagg" and an "Assault (sic) Rifle at Barack's Forehead," he was swiftly arrested.

While Sims reportedly was smiling when reading his tweets aloud to the Secret Service, who knocked on his door just a few days later, he later apologized for his stupidity. That apology came up just a wee bit short though as he was later sentenced to six months in prison for knowingly and willfully making a threat to take the life of the president.

7. Teen Jailed for Kindergarten Shooting "Sarcasm": Oh, those gamers, they get so heated when they battle across the Internet, so much so that in February 2013, when 18-year-old Justin Carter was insulted by a League of Legends gamer, he posted some fighting words back of his own.

"I think Ima shoot up a kindergarten / And watch the blood of the innocent rain down / And eat the beating heart of one of them" was what Carter posted, and just as anyone with half a brain would expect, he was soon arrested. Carter claimed that his messages were "sarcastic," even using the fact that he also typed "lol" and "jk" as his defense; authorities didn't agree.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947159.jpg">

8. Sick Jokes About Missing Kids Land Teen in Prison: Taking sick jokes to a whole new and very much criminal level, meet Matthew Woods. This British teen had the brilliance to post jokes on Facebook stating "I woke up this morning in the back of a transit van with two beautiful little girls, I found April in a hopeless place." and "Who in their right mind would abduct a ginger kid?"

Now out of context, these might not seem something that would land him behind bars, but considering there were two little girls missing at the time, a highly covered story by the news media, no one was laughing at his comments. Woods, who claimed a defense of intoxication, spent three months in the pokey on charges of sending by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947160.jpg">

9. Teen Doesn't "Get Away With It Like Zimmerman": Lots of people were upset when George Zimmerman was found not guilty of the murder of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in July 2013. Just one however, went to Twitter to threaten mass murder because of it. 15-year-old "Mark" was that one.

The teen posted, "If Zimmmerman free imma shoot everybody in Zion causing a mass homicide, and ill get away wit it just like Zimmerman," just before the verdict was announced. Though it was quickly deleted, police got wind of the threat and pulled "Mark" into the station for questioning. The good news is that the cops determined that he was no threat and had no means of carrying out an act of that kind and let him off with a Class 4 felony charge, disorderly conduct.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947161.jpg">

10. Twitter Time-Bomb Mention Pulls Teen from Pink Concert: When you're excited about attending a concert and want to express that on social media, it might be wise to step back and think before you tweet. An Aussie teen learned that lesson the hard way in July 2013, when he posted on Twitter this lapse of judgement, "@Pink I'm ready with my Bomb. Time to blow up #RodLaverArena. Bitch."

Though the kid was just referencing Pink's song "Timebomb," security at the concert rightfully treated the message like an actual threat and nabbed him when he arrived at the Melbourne arena. The kid was arrested, and his father had to angrily drive three hours to help sort things out. Public nuisance charges were filed and the kid missed out on the concert that got him so excited in the first place. Not a good night for anyone involved!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947162.jpg">

11. Olympic Twitter Rant Goes a Step Too Far: Athletes are easy targets for hate mail when they lose, but in the case of British diver Tom Daley, the messages he received after failing to medal at the 2012 Olympics took that hate to a scary new level. Twitter user @Rileyy_69 didn't just go on a rant about how Daley "let us all down" and how he would "rather support a tramp," this fan, or former fan, threatened to shoot the Brit too.

"I hold a gun license for shooting birds and I'm gonna shoot yours as well," was the tweet that earned @Rileyy_69 a visit from Dorset police following a tip from Olympic officials, who were closely monitoring Twitter for safety reasons. Charges for malicious communications soon followed. No word on the kid's new favorite athlete following this incident
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947163.jpg">

12. A DUI Is No Laughing Matter: Similar to the many who were busted for bragging about their crimes on social media, a Kentucky teen learned that when one hits a car full of teenagers whilst driving under the influence, posting about it with a LOL expression isn't very wise.

18-year-old Paula Asher did that in September 2012, and the message attracted the eyes of the victims' parents. The parents went to the Woodford County judge, who ordered Asher to remove the post. She declined and was charged with contempt of court. Two days in the clink, in addition to her DUI sentence, were added on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947164.jpg">

13. Horrible Rap Lyrics Lead To Arrest: Few these days are surprised when song lyrics mention unsavory or straight up criminal acts. The distinction, however, between a threat and just making music is that when an unknown aspiring rapper posts comments talking about crimes, it's far from completely clear that he's just rapping.

Terroristic Rap Lyrics Bomb for Massachusetts Teen...Meet Cameron D'Ambrosio. This 18-year-old from Methuen, Massachusetts, posted "f*** a boston bombing [sic] wait til u see the s*** I do, I'ma be famous for rapping, and beat every murder charge that comes across me." on Facebook in May 2013. The completely not famous non-rapper's threats were forwarded to local law enforcement and he was swiftly arrested. The charges, of threats to make a bomb or hijack a vehicle, were eventualy dropped, but not before D'Ambrosio spent some time behind bars for his flow.

14. Ex-Husband's Elaborate Facebook Hoax Backfires: This is one of the stranger stories.In 2011, David Voelkert plotted to turn the tables on his ex-wife by playing along with her plot to seduce him on Facebook and get him to talk about harming her. Angela Voelkert made a fake profile of a local teen, friended David, and proceeded to listen as David talked about how he wanted to kill her.

Normally, this would be a criminal situation, and it was for a while, but David somehow knew that this was a complete ruse and planned ahead. He produced a notarized affidavit explaining that he knew this teen was really his ex-wife in disguise and played along only to prove that Angela was trying to tamper with his life. His plan worked but not before he spent four days in custody while this wild web was untangled
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/84947166.jpg">

15. Woman Broadcasts Her Drunk Drive Home on Periscope: A Florida woman was arrested after she broadcast her intoxicated drive home on the social media app Periscope. Whitney Beall had had a few too many when she got behind the wheel of her car and declared to the few dozen people watching her on the app "“I’m driving home drunk, let’s see if I get a DUI."

She did, as she was reported by several watchers to 911, and police found her, drunk and driving with a flat tire, running into a curb. She didn't get jail time, but did get a year of probation, work released, community service, and had her license suspended for six months

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">30 of the Tiniest Things People Got Offended Over</a>
1. Had someone get offended by me calling my brother "bro". They insisted that I was racist and that white people can't be related to Mexicans.

Like seriously lady. That's not how genetics work. We are 100% related and are a mix of white and Native American. Its not that unheard of for one biological sibling to come out lighter or darker than the other.

And even if we weren't related... Seriously? I'm racist for calling someone close to me my bro despite being different skin tones? Seriously?

Thank you for coming to my rant session. Have a good day.

2. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the Fire Marshall because he was talking about something being flame retardant (her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word.). It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her but instead I just stood off to the side probably making a surprised pikachu face.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319593.jpg">

3. I am a disabled person. My life sucks because of my disability and no longer being able to do the things I used to love makes me quite depressed sometimes. Some a*****e tried to lecture me about how I was ableist for wishing there was a cure for my disability. F**k me for not enjoying being in constant pain and possibly ending up in a wheelchair in the future I guess.

4. People get very offended that I don't like being touched.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319572.jpg">

5. This guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume.

Some girl was *yelling* at him for being so offensive toward Jews and Muslims (she was neither Jewish nor Muslim). One of the Muslim guys at the party asked her what the f**k she was talking about but she didn't back down lol

I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be (inaccurately) offended on behalf of other cultures/religions
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319573.jpg">

6. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt, thought I was commenting on her ability to drive.

7. At my wedding we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian at my wedding (sister in law who hates me) fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the f**k are they supposed to know its vegetarian?

8. Sporks.

I once heard someone say, *"The spork is 'the devil's utensil' because it is the amalgamation of the masculine fork and the feminine spoon and is trying to blur gender lines in society."*
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319576.jpg">

9. A sandwich. I kid you not. My Ex husband was given a sandwich by our then 13yr old daughter and because she cut the sandwich he went off on a massive strop about how his sandwiches should never be cut etc. The poor kids face, she was crushed. It still winds me up no end every time I think about it.

10. _Happy holidays_ successfully triggered an entire demographic. I'm still amazed by it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319578.jpg">

11. I told my my sister in a PM that it’s “1st” not “1rst” after she posted something on Facebook with the spelling error. She flipped out saying how I’m a “bully” and I need to “appreciate that her spelling is more unique”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319579.jpg">

12. Using a walking stick. I was in a car accident a few years ago and it f****d my leg up. Since then i've been using a walking stick. I was walking to shop (pre-pandemic) and an old bloke gave me the dirtiest look i've ever seen.

"What do you need a cane for? you're only a kid..."

He actually got quite pissy just seeing me using a stick. Like, my dude, i'm just out trying to buy some milk, i don't need your s**t today. (i didn't say that out loud, i just said it to myself after i got home)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319580.jpg">

13. Maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn’t care to have my peers know what I was up to so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues.

At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, “are you taking this call on a cell phone?”
I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I’d be happy to continue it the next day when I’d be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point but did agree with the second.

To this day, I wonder what the hell he was talking about and where he was coming from.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319581.jpg">

14. I worked at a restaurant and we put up some Halloween decorations. We had to take them all down when someone found the glittery skull decoration offensive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319588.jpg">

15. It's specific to France. In french we have a way to address for a man (Monsieur), a married woman (Madame), an unmarried woman (Mademoiselle) and we use to have one for an unmarried man (Mondamoiseau) wich disappeard from official paperworks since i don't even know when.

In the name of gender equality, "mademoiselle" was also removed a few years ago from official paperwork. Also in the name of gender equality some employee were told to not call young women "Mademoiselle" anymore and to go with "Madame".

So the trick is, some women will get offended when called "Madame" because it makes them feel old and some women will get offended when called "Mademoiselle" because it's sexist. Clerks a doomed.

16. >Professor Greg Patton at the University of Southern California (USC) was telling students in a communications lecture last month about filler, or pause words, such as 'err', 'umm' or 'you know' in English.
>
>Footage of his lecture, which has now gone viral, shows Prof Patton saying: "In China, the common pause word is 'that, that, that'. So in China, it might be na-ge, na-ge, na-ge."
>
>Enunciated, na-ge sounds like the N-word, which led several of the professor's students to complain to the university. Responding to the complaint, the dean of the university, Geoffrey Garrett, told students that Prof Patton would no longer be teaching the course.
>
>"It is simply unacceptable for the faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students," he said.
>
>The university says that Prof Patton "volunteered to step away" from his role amid the investigation into complaints made against him.

This is the stupidest thing to get offended over that I've seen in quite a while. And damaging to actual cases of racist terminology being used inappropriately.

17. When I was a child, my mum paid for something with a cheque. The cashier remarked that my mum had nice hand writing
My mum flew off the handle, and we had to storm out of the shop in outrage.
To this day, I have no idea what happened.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319583.jpg">

18. One of my coworkers was surprised and said “Oh my god”.

A religious coworker overheard her using ‘god’s name in vain’ and reported it to HR. They had to have meetings with HR and the managers about respecting people’s religion. The lady said ‘oh my god’ she didn’t wish for the death of Christianity for f**k’s sake! It was ridiculous.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319584.jpg">

19. I got in trouble in kindergarten for saying the word dead. Apparently it was too violent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319585.jpg">

20. I was at the vet with my cat and he sneezed. This was apperently very offensive to an elder woman (she was there with a corgi) and she started screaming at me for about 30 minutes about pet hygiene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319586.jpg">

21. wearing a mask in public
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319587.jpg">

22. We used an app at work called Bonfyre. One person refused to use it because bonfires are for witchcraft and pagans.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319589.jpg">

23. When I worked in customer service:


"Yes ma'am"

...

"don't you ma'am me. don't you F*****G MA'AM ME YOU PIECE OF S**T!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319590.jpg">

24. I had a coworker who got mad at me because I asked her not to tickle me.

(a) That's inappropriate at work; (b) we're not children, we're not in a relationship, we're not family; (c) I DON'T LIKE BEING TICKLED.

She flipped out and said everyone likes being tickled and I was being mean to her. Happily my boss had my back.

Edit: this happened over a decade ago, I don't work with that woman or for that company. In fact, even the company doesn't exist anymore.

I am also a woman.

The coworker was very young and immature. This was her first job, her first time in a professional environment, and she really had no clue about professional workplace behavior. I wasn't upset because she truly thought she was being friendly.

But I still don't like being tickled.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319591.jpg">

25. My dad loves to tell the story of how, shortly after they were married, he and mom went to get some fast food. As they pulled up to the drive through window, my very conservative mom saw a sign that said "Condiments available upon request" and said "OMG, that's disgusting! WHY would a restaurant feel the need to give those out!?" She had misread it and thought they were giving out condoms upon request.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319592.jpg">

26. The guy who got offended in a council meeting because someone used the term "black hole".
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319594.jpg">

27. I spent 9 hours deep-cleaning the house for an inspection. I went above and beyond, clearing my work schedule and going the extra mile, and my roommate “double checked” my work. He had a complete psychotic meltdown because I forgot to sweep *underneath* the couch.

I moved out the next day and never spoke to him again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319595.jpg">

28. My mom got mad because and I quote "she never asks me for money" referring to me. I'm sorry, would you rather I constantly bug you for cash so I can buy candy and s**t?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319596.jpg">

29. The Pixar short Lava. He walked out saying it was deeply offensive and didn't explain why.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319597.jpg">

30. One Easter Sunday, a lady in church was wearing a hat that had the Easter Bunny, chicks, and colored eggs as part of its design.

The woman in the pew behind her took umbrage, telling the lady that Easter was about the *resurrection of Jesus from the dead*, not about "silly rabbits, chicks, and eggs."
