## <a href="#link1" id="link0">20 Disturbing Mysteries That Remain Unsolved</a>
1. Honestly the Cape Intruder isn't disturbing just weird as hell. During the night in Cape, Maine in like 2005 people who kept their doors unlocked would wake up to find a man staring at them and he would quickly flee. No people were ever injured and nothing was ever stolen. He just watched people sleep apparently. -whatislife40

2. The Axeman of New Orleans. Guy was murdering people but wrote a letter that he wouldn't kill anyone who played jazz in their home/business. Never caught. -BlueFalconPunch

3. West Mesa Bone Collector. Ok this one is extremely creepy- 12 women and girls identified, with the final victim being only 15. Satellite images show the final body was buried in 2005. The police release photos of women that appear to be sleeping or incapacitated saying they are of interest to the case but don’t explain how. -Temporary-Sundae2471

4. The Hinterkaifeck murders always freaked me out. I've read quite a bit about it, and it sounds like it was probably a neighbor. But the creepy part is that the killer was probably living/hiding out in the attic for multiple days beforehand. -TecateLanding

5. The disappearance of the Beaumont Children The Beaumont Children are siblings who disappeared in 1966, in Australia. There are still to this day investigations on going to try and find the remains of these children. There have been foundations of sheds and houses dug up.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112231/87289630/BeaumontChildren.jpg">

The children have never been found and the suspect(s) has never been identified. -jnrdingo

6. Technically not unsolved since everyone can guess what happened to her but it’s one of the creepiest IMO. Alissa Turney was a teenager who disappeared in 2001. Her stepfather, Michael Turney, was obsessed with her. He stalked her at work, and put cameras in the vents to spy on her. Michael picked her up from school early on May 17, 2001 and she’s never been seen since. -meyganvibes

7. The disappearance of Brandon Swanson. It's a lengthy case so I won't summarize here, but he went missing while on the phone with his parents, his last known words being "Oh shit" before the line went dead. Not a trace of him has ever been found. -bubble0peach

8. Alicia Navarro. She went missing, presumably after sneaking out to meet with a man she was talking to on Discord.

It's creepy because of how real it is. As a naive girl who met up with guys I befriended online as a teenager, I just cannot stop thinking about how goddamn lucky I was. -meladey
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112237/87289632/brianschaffer.jpg">

9. Murder of Betsy Aardsma. In 1969, Betsy, a student was killed in the stacks of the library at my old college (Penn State) and was found with a singular stab wound on her chest. It wasn’t even late or anything, and while there were many suspects, no one was ever arrested for it. It’s insane how someone could kill a person in broad daylight at a major university, and get away with it. -Rickdaquickk
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112248/87289634/ashadegree.jpg">

10. Brian Shaffer, who went missing from Columbus, Ohio. He was reported missing after a night out. There's security camera footage of him entering a bar, but absolutely no footage of him leaving. Like he went into the bar and just flat out dropped off the face of the earth. The last I knew, he's never been found and nobody knows what happened to him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112249/87289635/flight370.jpg">

The bar was on a second floor at that time with only one public entrance/exit. The police extensively reviewed all the security camera footage. Brian and everyone else who was there that night was seen on camera entering the bar. Everyone, except for Brian, who was at the bar that night was seen on camera leaving the bar. Which would nix any theories that he left wearing different clothes/disguised as someone else/mixed in with a crowd. -RedRose_812

11. Asha Degree. There’s so many weird things about the case to me. She went missing on her parent’s anniversary, she ran into the woods when approached, and likely left home in her pajamas. It feels like she left on her own, I just can’t begin to imagine why. -chesterlola2014
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112300/87289640/kyronhorman.jpg">

12. Flight 370 Malaysia Airlines. Disappeared without a trace. -ignaciodib
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112251/87289638/iowapaperboys.jpg">

13. Missy Bevers. A suspect in full SWAT armor breaks into a church and smashes windows and breaks opens doors with a hammer, looking for a local fitness instructor. They then find and beat her to death before getting away.

There is high quality surveillance video of both them and their car, but investigators couldn't make out the license plate. There has been a suspect who was cleared because of an alibi, and there's been no recent updates. -wedoabitoftrolling
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112300/87289641/sodder.png">

14. Kyron Horman. I feel like somebody knows something that will blow the case wide open but to this day nobody knows where he went or what happened to him. There are some solid theories out there but it’ll always be a mystery until we get an official answer. -candycrunch1
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/112304/87289643/theislandofeileanmor.jpg">

15. In the early 80s, all within 18 months of each other, three paperboys in the Des Moines, IA area all went missing during their morning route. The cases have never been solved. There are theories an ex-employee who was a creeper kidnapped them, and even a lone wolf type situation. It's a bizarre case that has baffled Iowa for years. -deleted

16. The disappearance of Zebb Quinn. He was 18 years old when he went missing in 2000. He was working his shift at a local Walmart and afterwards wanted to look at a new car with a colleague, when he allegedly received a call that made him take off frantically. After that he was never seen again.
