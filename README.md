## <a href="#link1" id="link0">People Share The Most Cringeworthy Things They've Ever Done</a>
1. We all have stories from our past that we've tried to forget. Events we've repressed so much that we're not even sure they actually occurred. These brave souls let their embarrassing skeletons out of their closets.  It's a beautiful reminder that, no matter our race, color or creed, we are all united by the dumb things we do.

2. "I invited a girl to hang out for coffee so I could tell her I was planning on dating someone else and wasn't interested (she was). It took me 8 hours to say it. We had a great conversation until then... Also, she gave me a ride home because the buses had stopped running, which is pathetic because I was 22."

3. "For about a month my freshman year of high school, I wore mirrored glasses and turtlenecks and told people I was a vampire."

4. "6th grade. Sometimes I would confuse something clear with the color white. Not the colors themselves, just the names of the colors. In health class we were discussing hydration and what the color of your urine meant. I raised my hand and asked 'what's it mean when you pee white?' I didn't understand the looks I got, especially from the teacher. I remembered the awkwardness and eventually put it all together. It is not a pleasant memory now."

5. "When I was much younger I would hump the fireman pole on the playground during recess. I didn't know what I was doing but it felt good. However, I was often the last person off the playground, doing this, and so many times everyone would wait, and watch, because nobody could go in until I was done and joined the class."

6. "In job interview I shook the employer's hand and said 'Hi, how are you?' (exercising my assertive social skills) which would've been fine except that I said it at the END of the f--king interview.‚Äù

7. "Big crush on a girl when I was in grade 12. She was so chill, easy to talk to (for a guy who was pretty socially awkward back in the day), and I'm sure looking back she was into me because she wrote her number into my yearbook. Well, until that summer when I confessed to her I was a virgin, with zero prompting, and asked if she wanted to be my first. She didn't talk much to me after that. 7 years and 3 relationships later and I still can't help but wonder what if."

8. "When I was younger, around 5-6 I think, my family and I went to visit a friend. He had a daughter and a son and I was quite close friends with the girl. We went up to play in her bedroom and for some reason, and I can't for the life of me remember why I thought it would be a good idea, decided to whip out my one inch wonder and proceed to wipe it on the walls of her bedroom whilst laughing. She excused herself whilst I was doing so and about a minute later I hear my parents shouting from downstairs. That was the most awkward car ride home EVER and I still cringe everytime I think of it."

9. "When I was in like 1st or second grade I had real bad diarrhea , But my teacher was a total b--ch about using the restroom. She had a rule that if you went to the bathroom during class, you couldn't go to recess, Well long story short, I sh-t myself, and instead of telling anyone, I sat in it, and proceeded to go to recess. Then the diarrhea (Which was a weird tan color lol) dripped down my leg and smelt just awful, The aide then took me to the nurse and I told em I fell in stinky mud... Although that no bathroom rule did get dropped, I never lived it down."

10. "When I was 13 I made a fake MSN account pretending to be one of those conversation bots. I added my crush and pretended to 'predict his future', which of course heavily hinted at eventually marrying me."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85058875.gif">

11. "When i was like 10, i'd gather all my family and friends, get on my hands and knees and show them the 'cool piggyback trick!' their border collie would perform on me. This carried on for about a year and no one told me i was being aggressively humped. i used to wonder why they were so awkward about it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85058877.jpeg">

12. "I walked into the break room at work once, and an attractive female coworker was in there. We all work at desks all day, so I tried to say something about stretching your legs, but instead out came 'so, came back here to spread your legs, eh?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85058878.gif">

13. "When I was in middle school, I had it in my head I had the whole dark and mysterious vibe locked down. Well I was really into the cute girl in my english class so I had the bright idea to write her a song.. sadly I wasn't lyrically gifted. So the next obvious course of action was to find a song I assumed no one else knew because I was the one to discover it: Point of Authority by Linkin Park. So I grabbed my old walkman, plugged in my original xBox mic (used for some karaoke game) and just sang along to the song while listening to it on my iPod. The tape didn't have any of the music to it, just my awkward pitchy prepubescent voice trying to be extra dark and mysterious. I even listened back to it and was 100% convinced it was the best thing since sliced bread. I gave it to her the next day in class, and sold it so confidently that she asked the teacher if she could play it for the class. Cue me red faced and itchy from head to toe with embarrassment from all the laughter."

14. "There was this one girl that I had a crush on in the last year of middle school, but I never really talked to her. On the last day of school I decided to tell her so I beckoned to her, whispered in her ear that I liked her and ran away."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85058880.gif">

15. "I once made a 'your mom' joke to a guy who's mother had literally just died the day before. In my defense I had no idea, but it was still pretty brutal."

A floating solar farm is more expensive to build than one on land, because it must be designed to withstand salt and humidity from water. But it has advantages: It can be built on otherwise unused surface. It works more efficiently, because the presence of water cools the panels as they generate electricity. It can mitigate evaporation of water, keeping the lake full for longer.

The statue boldly proclaims that South Dakota‚Äôs Native cultures are alive, standing with dignity.
When interviewed after the dedication, Lamphere said ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been well received by the Native community, and by visitors from all over the country. My hope over time is it really gets people to think about the beauty of the native cultures.‚Äù

11. US Marine returns a flag he took from a fallen Japanese soldier during WWII to the soldier‚Äôs family. They had never received any of his remains or belongings until that moment.

Marvin Strombo, who had taken the calligraphy-covered Japanese flag from a dead soldier at a World War II island battlefield 73 years ago, returned it Tuesday to the family of Sadao Yasue. They had never gotten his body or ‚Äî until that moment ‚Äî anything else of his.
Yasue and Tatsuya‚Äôs sister Sayoko Furuta, 93, sitting in her wheelchair, covered her face with both hands and wept silently as Tatsuya placed the flag on her lap. Strombo reached out and gently rubbed her shoulder.
‚Äò‚ÄòI was so happy that I returned the flag,‚Äô‚Äô Strombo said. ‚Äò‚ÄòI can see how much the flag meant to her. That almost made me cry ‚Ä¶ It meant everything in the world to her.‚Äô‚Äô
The flag‚Äôs white background is filled with signatures of 180 friends and neighbors in this tea-growing mountain village of Higashishirakawa, wishing Yasue‚Äôs safe return. The signatures helped Strombo find its rightful owners.
The smell of the flag immediately brought back childhood memories. ‚Äò‚ÄòIt smelled like my good old big brother, and it smelled like our mother‚Äôs home cooking we ate together,‚Äô‚Äô Tatsuya Yasue said. ‚Äò‚ÄòThe flag will be our treasure.‚Äô‚Äô

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">25 Lethal Facts About Bruce Lee</a>
1. Bruce Lee was born in the Year of the Dragon, on the Day of the Dragon, on the hour of the Dragon. Unsurprisingly, his nickname was Little Dragon.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126413.jpg">

2. Bruce Lee‚Äôs grandfather was one hundred percent German, which technically made Lee Eurasian. This ‚Äúnon-pure‚Äù Chinese status prevented him from being accepted into many kung fu schools in the 1950's due to discrimination and racism.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126414.jpg">

3. During his adolescence, he was a gang leader. The name of his group was The Tigers of Junction Street.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126415.jpg">

4. It might sound a little strange, but Lee‚Äôs early life was quite similar to the one portrayed in his movies. To make a long story short, he got into a fight with the son of a triad boss in Hong Kong when he was young, and his father shipped him off to the States the next day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126416.jpg">

5. He left for Seattle in 1958 with $100. While aboard the ship traveling to America, he gave cha cha lessons to first-class passengers to earn extra money.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126417.jpg">

6. He was able to name every karate term and perform each technique with deadly accuracy even though he was never officially taught the Japanese art of self-defense.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126418.jpg">

7. Lee had bad eyesight, which was one of the reasons he appreciated Wing Chun‚Äôs contact style of movement as he could rely more on touch than sight.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126419.jpg">

8. Bruce Lee‚Äôs favorite habit (other than martial arts, of course) was reading. He had an extensive library of more than two thousand books and read daily.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126420.jpg">

9. Contrary to the popular belief that Lee never participated in real combat competitions, he became the Hong Kong boxing champion, knocking out all his opponents including British boxer Gary Elms. He also defeated famous martial artist and teacher Wong Jack Man in a fight in 1965.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126421.jpg">

10. Bruce Lee used to puncture cans with his fingers back in the days when cans weren‚Äôt soft aluminum. He cut himself performing this on the set of The Big Boss though, so keep an eye out for the Band-Aids on his fingers next time you watch the film.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126422.jpg">

11. Time magazine named Bruce Lee one of the one hundred most influential people of the twentieth century. A few years later, in 2014, the Houston Boxing Hall of Fame voted him the Greatest Movie Fighter Ever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126423.jpg">

12. He weighed only 160 lbs. at his heaviest and was around 125 lbs. when he died.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126424.jpg">

13. He was capable of doing push-ups with a 250-pound man on his back. He could also do push-ups with only one finger.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126425.jpg">

14. Lee was chosen by Goldsea Asian American Daily as one of the ‚Äú100 Most Inspiring Asian Americans of All Time,‚Äù ranked second behind Daniel K. Inouye, the influential senator and Medal of Honor recipient.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126426.jpg">

15. In the popular Nintendo game series Pok√©mon, the fighting-type monster Hitmonlee is based on Lee.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126427.jpg">

16. To mark the occasion of what would have been Lee‚Äôs sixty-fifth birthday (November 27, 2005), a bronze statue of a shirtless Bruce adopting a martial arts pose was unveiled in Hong Kong, effectively kicking off a week long Bruce Lee festival.

17. UFC president Dana White considers Bruce Lee ‚Äúthe father of Mixed Martial Arts.‚Äù
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126429.jpg">

18. Bruce Lee developed an amazing trick, which you can find on YouTube, for showing off his speed: a person held a coin and closed his hand and, as he closed it, Lee would take it and could even swap the coin for another.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126430.jpg">

19. Lee mastered a technique called ‚Äúthe one-inch punch,‚Äù where he could deliver a devastating blow with his fist traveling only an inch before striking his opponent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126431.jpg">

20. In his first and only meeting with composer Lalo Schifrin (they worked together on Enter the Dragon), Bruce confessed that he often trained to the Mission: Impossible theme.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126432.jpg">

21. Despite rumors and reports to the contrary, Lee was never Chuck Norris‚Äôs instructor. They trained together, often trading techniques and ideas, but never had a student-teacher relationship.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126433.jpg">

22. However, he was the one who gave Norris his first movie job, but it wasn‚Äôt in Way of the Dragon, as many people believe. Actually, it was before that, when Lee was a stunt coordinator in a film called Wrecking Crew starring Dean Martin. Bruce got Chuck one quick scene, which started with one line of dialogue followed by a fight scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126434.jpg">

23. Film directors had to shoot Lee‚Äôs fight scenes at thirty-two frames per second instead of the usual twenty-four because he was so fast; they wanted to make them seem more realistic, especially his kicks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85126435.jpg">

24. At the peak of his stardom, Lee was challenged by so many people every time he was recognized in public that he used to carry a .367 Magnum. This is what happens when people everywhere want to fight you to prove their strength, I guess.
