## <a href="#link2" id="link1">One Man's Epic Struggle Against A Chicago Deep Dish Pizza</a>
1. "My wife  is interviewing people to join her practice today during an ophthalmological conference in Chicago. I came up from Atlanta with her to enjoy Chi-Town.  . I decided to get some famous Giordano's pizza for lunch.  In order to get the stuffed deep dish, you wait 45 minutes for the thing to cook. I opted for the Chicago Classic..."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2016/10/17/120326/85167206/11.jpg">

2. He soon realized the struggle that lay before him...

3. He later added "I have just removed to final slice of he pie and placed it on my plate. The waitress looks concerned and a bit disgusted. She offered me a box and I vehemently expressed that it would not be necessary. My face is tingling. I have just googled what this could be a symptom of. Typing is difficult as my hands are starting to tingle too."

4. The last entry was "The waitress looks concerned. The table of four people next to me just ordered a box for the remaining slices of the same size pizza I just ate alone. This is the single greatest accomplishment of my life. Alone. In a relatively vacant restaurant an hour bike ride south of Chicago city center, I have overcome all odds. If only one person reads this and is inspired by it, my sacrifice is worth it. I love you all. If my heart stops beating on my bike ride back into Chicago, my last breath will whisper, "Delicious," across space and time to reach pizza lovers across the globe.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">12 Character Deaths That Ruined Popular Television Shows</a>
1. Marissa – The OC...The OC was facing declining ratings and quality and decided to mix it up and have one of their main characters, Marissa Cooper, die in a terrible car accident. But the real victim of that fatal car accident was the show itself, which never recovered and was put out of its misery shortly after.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196545.jpg">

2. Lexa and Lincoln - The 100...The 100 started out as a show about space kids who came down to Earth, but after we discovered that there were humans still alive on the ground, the Grounders quickly became the most interesting part of the show. But the writers clearly hadn’t figured that out when they killed off two of the most compelling characters — Lexa and Lincoln — in really disappointing ways. Lexa was felled by a stray bullet and Lincoln was shot in the head unceremoniously by someone who got killed himself shortly after. Many fans have sworn not to watch the show's upcoming fourth season, but whether or not The 100 is ruined for good remains to be seen.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196546.jpg">

3. Curtis – Misfits...When Curtis died, all the original characters had left the show, and the audience was expected to care about an entirely new cast. While the writing on the show remained good, it’s pretty hard to convince audiences to stick with a show after all the original main characters are gone. We didn’t just care about ANY misfits, you know? We wanted OUR misfits.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196547.jpg">

4. Rita Bennett – Dexter...Rita was the balance to Dexter’s character, the person who (unintentionally) supplied cover for his murderous ways, and also inspired him to be a better person. Without her, the show struggled to find the balance that had made it so appealing in earlier seasons. I heard that the last season of Dexter got good again but I honestly don’t know because I gave up on it the second Colin Hanks was wrangling snakes or whatever
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196548.jpg">

5. McDreamy – Grey’s Anatomy...Grey’s Anatomy is famous for killing off major characters in totally ridiculous ways. A lot of people thought the show lost its way after the plane crash that killed off Lexie Grey and McSteamy (and Arizona’s leg, and Arizona and Callie’s marriage). But the last straw might have been McDreamy kicking it because of a surgical mistake after a car accident. What the crap.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196549.jpg">

6. Tara- Buffy...The reactions to Tara’s death was mixed — some people liked the path it sent Willow down, while others were upset that half of primetime network TV’s first lesbian couple was offed by a stray bullet. Tara was a fan favorite and many viewers stopped watching after her death — Buffy’s final season fell in the ratings from 4.4 million to 3.8 million viewers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196550.jpg">

7. Fox Mulder – The X-Files...While they didn’t exactly kill off Mulder permanently, his weird treatment in the last few seasons dulled the appeal of the show. The X-Files was all about Mulder AND Scully and the way they played off each other. Without that chemistry, the show lost its footing
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196551.png">

8. Charlie – Two and a Half Men...When Charlie Sheen lost his mind very publicly, he was killed off of his own show and replaced by Ashton Kutcher. Killing off a major character is always a bold move, but especially in a comedy. Replacing Sheen with Kutcher did add to some renewed interest in the show, but without two of the original three main characters (Angus T. Young converted to Christianity and decided the show went against his morals), Two and a Half Men basically became a spin-off of itself. It lasted two more seasons before being canceled, so I guess the question is which version of the show did you like better?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196552.jpg">

9. Laurel – Arrow...Laurel Lance started out as a badass, independent woman. She died in recovery after surviving surgery and didn’t even have time to say goodbye to her dad. People were pretty freaking pissed that she was all "I’m glad you found happiness, it’s okay you don’t love me but I love you" right before she kicked it. Not a befitting ending for a strong woman, and her death turned Arrow into The Felicity Show. Ratings dropped off in the episodes after Laurel’s death because we didn’t sign up to watch the dang Felicity Show.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196553.png">

10. Curtis – 24...How are there two Curtises on this list?! Jack Bauer shot his pal Curtis in the head because Curtis kidnapped a bad dude. Because Jack Bauer has never kidnapped a bad dude?! Or murdered someone?! Weird change in morals. This felt like a gratuitous death of a major character that just pissed people off. It didn’t need to happen, it was just a ratings grab and a disrespectful end for a well-liked character. Boo. We expected 24 to stick to what it did best — advocating torture and depicting a world where nobody eats, sleeps, or goes to the bathroom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196554.jpg">

11. Glenn – The Walking Dead?While this death only happened a couple weeks ago and we don’t know what the show will be like without him, a lot of fans are pissed as hell that Glenn will no longer be on the show. Yeah, we know Negan killed him in the comics in the same way he was offed on the show, but the show has diverted from the comics before. And his eye popping out? God damn. That was truly awful, even for a show full of death, misery, and gore. There are so few season one characters still alive and Glenn was one of the most relatable. F*ck. I’m sad now.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Girl Makes Pillow Men To Get Revenge On Spying Ex-Boyfriend</a>
1. Today in Things That Have Made International News And We Don’t Know Why, a young lady from the UK got some sweet revenge on her ex-boyfriend. 18-year-old Tiffany Badland had broken up with her boyfriend, over three weeks ago. Yet the spurned lover continued to show up at her house uninvited to spy on her, peering through her windows. Damn, why can’t he just spy on her through Facebook like a normal ex?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148835.jpg">

2. Tiffany told The Sun that her former boyfriend turns into a peeping tom after he’s knocked back a couple brews with the boys. “He goes out every weekend with his friends and gets really drunk and looks through my windows.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148836.jpg">

3. So in order to get revenge on the guy who would routinely be caught peeking through the cracks of her blinds, she concocted a plan. She took pillows and blankets and stuffed them into her ex’s tracksuit he left behind in order to make what she calls “pillow men.” She wanted her ex to think that one of the pillow men was his own brother. And so she and some friends ordered Chinese food one night, and sat on the couch pretending to canoodle with the fake dudes.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148837.jpg">

4. While this sounds like a farfetched scheme, sure enough the drunk ex-boyfriend showed up at Tiffany’s house with his bros, and peeked in the window. He was enraged when he saw the girl with her arm around the “man” – even appearing to make out with him. And in some sort of Shakespearean twist the ex-boyfriend did indeed believe it to be his own flesh and blood brother who had betrayed him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148838.jpg">

5. He began banging on the windows and yelling at the girl and her “new lover.” However the prank may have backfired as the ex-boyfriend in still convinced that his brother was actually hooking up with Tiffany and he witnessed the whole thing. This despite the fact she posted the pillow men on social media and revealed the prank. That must have been some dummy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85148839.jpg">

6. She posted on Facebook;

“When your ex is a weirdo who spies through your windows with his mates when he’s wrecked to see if you have lads round, so you make some pretend lads just to piss him off. Absolutely howling!!!”
