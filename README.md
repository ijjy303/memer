## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Guy's Amazing Honesty After Finding His Wife In Bed With His Best Friend</a>
1. This guy shared his story, which ended differently than you might imagine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85190978.jpg">

2. "I unexpectedly finished my route 2 hours early. That meant I was going to get home at 3am instead of 5am. I decided to not call or text my wife because I didn't want to wake her."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85190979.jpg">

3. "So, I walked in the door and was going to surprise her with some unexpected sex. She usually is all for that.. she's kind of a freak and likes to wake up to sexual acts."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85190980.jpg">

4. "What I wasn't expecting was our best friend to be in bed with her. He didn't move much until he noticed it was me. He jumped up out of my bed real fucking quick once he finally woke up enough to realize I got home early. He then walked up to me and tried to say hello. My wife never even woke up! How the fuck do you not wake up?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85190981.jpg">

5. "I finally talked to my wife about it. She apologized. Just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for listening. Any advice would be appreciated."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85190982.jpg">

6. The guy took a photo of his best friend. This is him. Not feeling even a bit guilty. What an animal...
