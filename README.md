## <a href="#link1" id="link0">Couple Moves Into An Older Home And Find A Fallout Shelter</a>
1. When  Colleen and Chris Otcasek bought a new home in Woodland Hills, they had no idea that their new home held a pretty awesome secret. I mean, it had the usual features that you look for in a home; great kitchen large bedrooms, a huge backyard…With the except of their very own FALLOUT SHELTER!

2. The real estate agent told them that the lot had a pretty ‘unusual feature’ in the back yard; a large, concrete-lined hole. They were told that the hole used to lead to a fallout shelter from the Cold War Era, but in all honesty, no one had gone down there all this time.

3. One day, they were feeling brave, so they invited someone from the local radio station and went down the rusted ladder and found an old door at the bottom.

4. Inside they found a small fallout shelter, large enough for a family of four, full of everything you’d need to survive a nuclear attack. The bunker contained water, canned food, clothing, and medicine, as well as magazines and books. Everything was still pristine and vintage.

5. So wondering who’d be the type of person to build a fallout shelter in the middle of a valley outside of Los Angeles, so they did a little research and contacted the media. While building a fallout shelter during the cold war was a common practice, to find one like this one, it must have had a pretty interesting story.

6. Soon they got a hit from Debrah Kaufman, who visited the couple at the house and told the couple that her father Alvin, was the one to build the shelter, back in 1961. He figured, if he built it 15 feet below ground, it would be safe enough for his family.

7. Alvin Kaufman was a self-taught nuclear engineer working as a contractor for a few companies, testing the effects of nuclear war on industry and of course, what it would do to humans. Knowing firsthand what the effects were, he wanted to do something to keep his family safe.The irony, though, is that he approached everyone in his cul-de-sac and offered to build one big enough for everyone. They said no. So he just made one for himself and his family, filled with several sleeping areas, a water tank, a hand cranked air filter and enough food to last several weeks.

8. The shelves were full of  food from the era, all still sealed.

9. This is probably the most important thing for a fallout shelter, coffee. Although this can has seen better days.

10. Multi-Purpose food, was a powdered protein mix that was created by a California inventor, by the name of Clifford E. Clinton and his biochemist friend Dr. Henry Borsook in 1946. The MPF was meant to provide proper nutrition at a very affordable price.

11. A few board games to help pass the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258301.png">

12. Food storage options, of course.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258292.jpg">

13. No shelter is complete with out plenty of tissue and toilet paper!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258293.jpg">

14. Just in case you want to play some post-nuclear Beer Pong!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258294.jpg">

15. Plenty of clothing so you can keep your sense of style in the post-apocalyptic world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258295.jpg">

16. First Aid kit, with various powders and ointments. This was a common thing to find in Cold War Era fallout shelters.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258296.jpg">

17. Medications.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258297.jpg">

18. They also found many editions of the Analog Science Fiction and Fact Magazine, full of stories from the major Sci-Fi writers of the day. Definitely a must read when you’re trapped in a small cube with the rest of the world destroyed!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258298.jpg">

19. Deborah also shared some items that she took from the shelter when she sold to the Otcaseks, including some of her dad’s books on Nuclear fallout.

20. Kaufman, who died in 2004, was a pragmatist to wanted to make sure he was prepared for everything and these books were important to him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258300.png">

21. The couple plans to leave the shelter as it is for the next homeowners to find as a surprise.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Take A Look Inside An Abandoned Love Hotel in Japan</a>
1. The Fuurin Motel in Tokyo, Japan, was once used as a place for lovers to rendezvous. It was abandoned 17 years ago and locals are scared to go near the 'love hotel' because they think it is haunted by spirits.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285272.jpg">

2. The hotel is now derelict. Most of the ceilings are collapsing in, littering the floor with shards of plaster, wood and wallpaper.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285273.jpg">

3. There are ten themed rooms in the hotel, and many had traditional Japanese touches. Pictured, a decaying wall painting of a woman and embroidered chairs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285274.jpg">

4. Pictured, a traditional lamp hangs off a top shelf in a room, next to a stuffed bird. Even though the suite is supposed to model a Japanese woodland scene, it features a TV and air conditioners.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285275.jpg">

5. Pictured, a rotting embroidered bed sits in an alpine-themed room
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285276.jpg">

6. Pictured, a room modeled to look like a traditional Japanese Roykan. The style is characterised by straw mats, panelling, and low tables. A Roykan is a 17th century inn, where travellers could stop for the night and rest.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285277.jpg">

7. Pictured, one of the suites is decorated to look like a Classical Greek room.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285278.jpg">

8. All the suites include a dining room and a bathroom. Pictured, mould grows in a fading pink hot tub filled with muddy brown water. The room has started to be invaded by nature as tree branches push through the ceiling and the two windows.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/566750/85285279.jpg">

9. One of the most intricate and elaborate rooms is a Medieval-themed suite.
