## <a href="#link9" id="link8">8 People Who Got In Trouble Because of Selfies</a>
1. North Carolina resident Natasha Kirkland was excited to be pregnant with baby number four and posted a picture of her growing baby bump on Facebook. Although the image sat in the feed for a couple of days virtually unnoticed, more observant people saw glaring issues which landed her behind bars just three days after sharing the photo.

Evidently, her "haters" online wondered if she was pregnant since she hadn't posted any belly shots yet. Natasha must have been in such a hurry to take a picture and shut her haters down that she dropped everything she was doing before taking the photo, as her drugs and syringes were left in plain sight on a stool in the background. She couldn't claim that the narcotics weren't hers since she also left the elastic tie-off on her upper arm.

Surprisingly, Natasha was only held accountable for some outstanding offenses, including driving with a revoked license, felony credit card fraud, and felony obtaining property under pretenses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85370606.jpg">

2. The day before his wedding, a United Kingdom man took his last "single" selfie and posted it on Twitter with a sweet message about how scared, yet excited, he was to marry his bride to be, but there was just one problem he took the photo while driving, which is illegal. He outed himself while wearing his sunglasses, which reflected the road ahead of him as he held his phone in one hand and steered with the other. 

An officer stumbled upon the selfie on Twitter and responded with, "Just to keep everyone current on the situation... It is people like this who end up destroying people lives through their own stupidity," referring to the dangers of distracted driving. Please get in touch, and we'll send you your wedding present. $200 fine & 6 points, tweeted the Northumbria Police's official account. 

After being caught red-handed, the driver, who used the handle @Geordie_aviator, deactivated his Twitter account, presumably to keep authorities from actually being able to find and ticket him for his careless stunt.

3. Bragging and going on a spending spree is the last thing any self-respecting thief should do. The alleged mastermind behind an audacious Ocean's Eleven-style airport heist was arrested after posting a selfie with his brand new Lamborghini on social media. 

The kingpin is suspected of being the brains behind a slick raid at South Africa's main international airport which saw an armed gang dressed as police officers seize 15 million in cash as it was loaded on a plane to London. Detectives swooped on the luxury home of the gang's alleged boss after he uploaded pictures of himself and his friends posing with the new $500,000 wheels.

4. On February 2017, a New York woman was arrested for stealing a $13,000 mink coat after posting a photo of herself wearing it on Instagram. 

Angeline Chidowore, 39, worked at the high-end clothing store Moda Operandi and was in charge of inventory. After the coat had gone missing, her boss found pictures of her wearing it on Instagram. She was soon arrested and charged with grand larceny and criminal possession of stolen property.

5. The arsonist behind California's King Fire in 2014 all but gave himself up to police thanks to a selfie video he took after starting the inferno.

Wayne Allen Huntsman, 39, was given 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to starting the fire, which ravaged 97,717 acres of California forest and 112 buildings over 27 days. And his conviction was inevitable, thanks to his vanity and a quick-thinking good Samaritan.

Huntsman hiked out into the woodlands near King of the Mountain Road in Pollock Pines, El Dorado County on September 13, 2014, and lit two fires blazes he would later claim to investigators were to keep him warm on the record 93-degree day. He then used his cellphone to record a video leaving what appeared to be a last message to his girlfriend, swinging it around to show the smoke rising. "I've got fires all around me. Look at me, babe," he says in the video. "I'm stuck in the middle babe. ... I love you. I always have."
He then fled to a local highway, where a passing retired firefighter, Lars Knutsen, "rescued: him. Huntsman then showed Knutsen the video, and Knutsen recognizing its importance recorded that video on his cell phone.

6. A policeman was caught taking a selfie as a man prepared to jump to his death from a bridge. During the desperate man's final moments, the selfie-obsessed cop is seen posing for a snapshot just feet away.

The man is caught in the background of the policeman's shot, clinging to the bridge in the Turkish capital of Ankara. Just seconds later he leaped almost 600ft to his death, after attempts by other officers to talk him down failed.

The picture of the policeman's heartless selfie sparked fury in Turkey, and he now faces an investigation. The 35-year-old man who jumped from the bridge was later identified as Sadrettin Saskn.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85370611.jpg">

7. A Brooklyn native posted a photo of himself on his Facebook page brandishing a submachine gun he allegedly used in a Michigan bank robbery, and the FBI busted him.

In the picture, Jules Bahler is holding a menacing-looking, long-barreled, assault-style weapon. In the other hand, he is holding a black smartphone, which he uses to take a picture of himself in a bathroom mirror.

Bahler, 21, who calls himself "King Romeo" on his Facebook page, posted the photo in March 2014 with the accompanying caption, "Bought my first house And chopper today, life's great." That same day, according to an FBI affidavit, Bahler entered a Chemical Bank branch in Bay City, brandished a submachine gun and fled with about $7,000. Authorities said Bahler committed two similar crimes in Pontiac, robbing a credit union of $4,300, and a Bank of America branch of $4,000 a few days before.

Before his arrest, a friend tried to warn him about the selfie. U tripping brotha. I wouldn't show that shit off like that, cops be watching this shit brotha.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85370612.jpg">

8. The 2015 Playmate of the Year came under fire in 2016 after she photographed a 70-year-old naked woman without her knowledge in an LA Fitness locker room and posted it on Snapchat with the caption,  If I can't unsee this then you can't either.

Dani Mathers was quickly slammed on social media for body shaming and was banned from all LA Fitness locations. In November, she was charged with a misdemeanor count of invasion of privacy, and sentenced to perform 30 days of community service and three years probation. 

The model, 30, says she has received death threats since the incident went viral last year and has apologized. I never meant to hurt her. I never, ever intended on showing the world this photo. I hope that she could forgive me. I just want her to be able to move on and move forward in her life and not feel judged, or that she what she was doing was being ridiculed, because it had nothing to do with that and I'm so sorry, Mathers said.
