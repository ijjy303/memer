## <a href="#link2" id="link1">People Share The Weirdest Things They've Seen  Over Someone's Shoulder</a>
1. 50 year old guy sitting on the train in front of me was shamelessly reading One Direction fanfiction. I say 'shamelessly' because it was open full screen on his computer and I'm pretty sure the font was even turned up to be bigger than default.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315616.jpg">

2. I once busted my little brother looking up "naked Pokemon, naked Pikachu" and "big titty black women". It's been almost 20 years. Every few years I'll give him some Pok√©mon related gift for his birthday with a "never forget" card attached
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315614.jpg">

3. My brother was a voracious user of the old AOL chatrooms. One day out of the blue in conversation with an AOL user from France, he started typing out the french language. I was amazed. Who knew that my brother could converse in french? He never had a french language lesson in his life, never spoke a word in french or any other foreign language, he never cracked open a book on anything, he had no french friends or acquaintances off line, etc. How he knew how to speak in french is a total mystery to me to this day. Never saw him do it again.

4. I found a guy searching for "old granny sex tape" on pornhub, later on I asked him why an old lady and he said:"all we see is youngs or milfs, I needed to change my sight".
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315618.jpg">

5. I saw someone going through the pictures on their phone showing something to someone next to them and needless to say, he forgot he had pictures of him balls deep in a girl (I also somewhat knew) and it scrolled by as he was skimming through the photos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/04/05/121102/85316442/Phoz.jpg">

6. Some 9th grade kids on my bus really like Hitomi Tanaka
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315622.jpg">

7. Saw one of my 29 year old coworkers looks at my little pony on his computer, wears a my little pony lanyard, has a my little pony sticker on his external hard drive and wears my little pony t-shirts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315620.jpg">

8. looked over a guys shoulder on the bus he was searching through images of blue waffle, the only thing I could describe this guy as is fucked in the head mental shit
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315621.jpg">

9. They were probably suffering from short term amnesia. I sat next to a lady on a bus for a little over an hour. She repeatedly went back to a meme about Valentine's day and laughed at it. She then kept starting to forward it to friends, going back to her Facebook feed and scrolling through all the posts she had just read, arriving at the meme, reading it intently again, laughing, forwarding it to a friend... This went on for 45 minutes
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315615.jpg">

10. Found another furry looking at furry porn in class.Never talked to them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/04/05/121113/85316443/Porn.jpg">

11. I was on the bus and this guy in front of me was trying to sell 150 editions of Playboy on eBay on his phone. He looked a little sketchy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315624.jpg">

12. Was on a train once and the guy in front of me was googling "Lois Griffin naked big bum".

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">10 Of The Most Paused Scenes In Movie History</a>
1. In ‚ÄòBasic Instinct,‚Äô Sharon Stone‚Äôs character Catherine Tramell uses her sex appeal to distract the police interrogating her. A simple crossing of her legs leaves all the officers staring and baffled. Boobs or not, you can‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt hit pause on that scene.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177066.jpg">

2. During the pterodactyl attack scene in ‚ÄòJurassic World,‚Äô you may have missed the famous Jimmy Buffett grabbing a few margaritas and running for cover. After this scene his character might not be wastin‚Äô away again in Margaritaville.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177067.jpg">

3. Who doesn‚Äôt remember the famous scene in ‚ÄòFast Times at Ridgemont High‚Äô that made the 80‚Äôs amazing? In a daydream, Brad Hamilton (Judge Reinhold) pictures Linda Barrett (Phoebe Cates) getting out of the pool in a red bikini and slowly taking off her top. It may have been a daydream in the film but it was very real for pre-teens everywhere.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177068.jpg">

4. The first ‚ÄòIron Man‚Äô held back on hidden easter eggs, but there‚Äôs one that got people excited. Pepper walks in on Tony having the Iron Man suit removed and under Tony‚Äôs right arm you can see a prototype of Captain America‚Äôs shield sitting on the table.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177069.jpg">

5. Probably one of the most notable movie mishaps happens in ‚ÄòStar Wars: A New Hope‚Äô when one clumsy Storm Trooper hits his head walking through a doorway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177070.gif">

6. With Jones pointing a rocket launcher at Dr. Ren√© Belloq (Paul Freeman) in ‚ÄòRaiders of the Lost Ark,‚Äô it may be hard to notice that a fly lands on Belloq‚Äôs face and makes its way into his mouth. The scene was never cut and made it into the finished film.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177071.jpg">

7. It‚Äôs no secret that Margot Robbie is a beautifully hypnotic woman. In ‚ÄòWolf of Wall Street,‚Äô she plays Jordan Belfort‚Äôs smoke show of a wife, Naomi. In one scene the two get into an argument and Naomi uses her fiery good looks against Jordan. Don‚Äôt lie I know you were biting your knuckles too!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177072.jpg">

8. When the fight between Superman and General Zod makes its way to space, they smash into a satellite. You can see the Wayne Enterprises logo plastered on the side, meaning that Batman and Superman existed in the same world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177073.jpg">

9. ‚ÄòFight Club‚Äô was full of little easter eggs here and there but some were too quick to notice without hitting pause. Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) appears for a single frame a few times during the first act. This is your life and it‚Äôs ending one minute at a time so don‚Äôt miss these quick moments that make ‚ÄòFight Club‚Äô the amazing film it is.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85177074.jpg">

10. In ‚ÄòStar Wars: The Force Awakens,‚Äô Luke Skywalker appears only a single scene in the film. Some people say that Luke is standing next to a gravestone of someone special where others say it‚Äôs just an oddly shaped stone.
