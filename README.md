1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169179.jpg">

5. Removing the string...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169183.jpg">

6. Opening the box...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169184.jpg">

7. The box reveals its secrets! A few packages wrapped in what looks like wax paper.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169185.jpg">

8. There was a news paper lining the bottom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169186.jpg">

9. Here is the back of the news paper. Nothing significant in the paper. It may have just been there to protect the other contents.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169187.jpg">

10. The paper is dated March 25, 1951. This must be near the time the box was hidden.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169188.jpg">

11. Three packages...Now I am really interested! this looks green! There's money in here! I am guessing a thousand or more! Is that a twenty?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169189.jpg">

12. The full contents.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169190.jpg">

13. These are all twenties! There may be a couple thousand here!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169191.jpg">

14. Full contents revealed!
The second package didn't have any twenties. It was all fifties! What is going on here? There could be 5 grand here!. Wait!!!! The third package is 100s!!!!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/883100/85169192.jpg">

15. Some of the bills were rarer than others. Some brown notes, a gold certificate and some star notes nearly uncirculated. All bills were from 1928-1934.
