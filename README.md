3. On air suicide.
In 1974, Christine Chubbuck committed suicide during her live broadcast of the morning news.

Then she pulled out a gun and shot herself in the head.

7. Balloon boy.
In 2009, the country watched as a balloon flew out of control with a child inside. CNN, along with many other networks, covered the event live and it turned out to be a hoax.

8. Live suicide.
Fox News was covering a live car chase in in Phoenix when the driver, Jordan Romero, got out of his vehicle and committed suicide. The network immediately apologized for showing it live but it was already too late. Nobody could unsee what they just saw on the live broadcast

10. Casey Anthony not guilty.
Not since the O.J. Simpson trial was the nation as memorized by a court trial as they were during the Casey Anthony trial. What was expected to be read as a guilty verdict shocked everyone as she was found not guilty.

11. Manila hostage situation.
In 2010, people watched a live broadcast of former Manila police officer Rolando Mendoza taking hostages on a tour bus. In the end eight of the hostages were shot and killed as the cameras were on the bus. Since the event took place inside of the bus the cameras did not catch the murders.

12. Earnhardt dies at Daytona.
In 2001 at the Daytona 500, racing fans watched as Dale Earnhardt's car slammed into the wall and he was killed. Earnhardt was arguably the most popular driver in racing and the race was one of the biggest of the year. The crash didn't look to be that bad but it didn't take long to realize that it was.

13. A tense landing.
In 2005, we watched live as JetBlue Flight 292 was in trouble while landing. The difference in this event was that the passengers on the plane were actually able to watch the live television broadcast on their in seat televisions. All of the televisions were turned off just before the plane actually landed but they all knew they were in trouble.

Even though the landing gear was clearly not working properly, the pilot was able to land the plane safely as the country watched live.

15. The 2000 Presidential election.
The 2000 Presidential election was complete madness on election day. No network had a handle on the results coming in and CNN actually announced Al Gore as the winner before recanting the statement shortly afterward. Several networks reported different projected winners numerous times throughout the evening and nobody that was watching the live broadcasts had any idea who the real winner was until the following day.

16. Berlin Wall is no more.

18. O.J. not guilty.
In 1995, the world was watching one of the most famous court cases in history. When the verdict was read everyone expected a guilty verdict to be read. Shock and amazement consumed the world as we watched live as the verdict of not guilty was read.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174294.jpg">

19. Man on the moon.
600 million people watched live on July 20, 1969 as the United States put the first ever person on the moon. Neil Armstrong became famous when he told the world, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." When you hear shows that broadcast live talk about their high number of viewers remember that number. 600 million. That's simply amazing.

20. World Series earthquake.
Game 3 of the 1989 World Series was postponed after a deadly earthquake hit the San Francisco bay area. The quake happened during the pre game show and was witnessed by millions live as it happened. Throughout the night the devastation was broadcast live around the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174296.jpg">

21. Hurricane Katrina.
Today's weather forecasters can predict the landfall of a hurricane a week or so before it actually happens. This gives networks plenty of time to set up and capture the upcoming devastation. The Weather Channel broadcast the storm as it happened live and continued to do so several days after it hit. It brought the world the catastrophic events live.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174297.jpg">

22. O.J.'s slow car chase.
Before the world watched O.J. Simpson getting away with murder on live television, they watched live as he led police on a slow car chase when they were trying to take him into custody. The live coverage of the event consumed the nation as everything seemed to come to a halt so the world could watch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174298.jpg">

23. 9/11.
We all watched in horror as the second plane was purposely flown into the second World Trade Center building on live television. The cameras were trained on the first building, covering what no one really knew was happening at the time.

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">Owner Shares Last Day With Her Beloved Pup</a>
1. She had this to say:
“For about two months Hannah has been having seizures, they were small and nothing to worry about, but they gradually got worse. Hannah was on a couple of meds, one for her kidneys and another for the pain she had in her elbows and her hips.
When she wasn’t on her meds, she didn’t have really bad seizures, she had them, but they weren’t horrible, but when she wasn’t on her meds, she couldn’t walk well or make it up the stairs, several times she fell down them or up them.
I finally decided that keeping her on the meds was selfish, but keeping her off of them was just as cruel. So I decided to give her one last hoo-rah day of pampering, like the queen she’s always been, and let her go. Where there would be no pain, no seizures, no whimpering in the night. Just peace and hopefully love.❤ R.I.P. Hannah.“

2. I was promised jet packs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274329.jpg">

3. High-speed transcontinental railway system in the USA.

4. Efficient water desalination and or plastic recycling.

5. Dental regrowth would be friggin sweet! Expensive...but sweet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274319.png">

6. Cure of most genetic diseases or cancer or Alzheimer's.

7. Full-time operational fusion energy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274322.jpg">

8. Universal translator.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274324.png">

9. Any human-made mechanism that can mimic the CO2 recycling of trees at scale to truly change the numbers on medium and long-term climate change impact. (Short-term is not good.)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274331.jpeg">

10. I've been telling my children for years that in their lifetime, when they need an organ transplant, doctors will just grow an exact genetic match for them in a vat. Time to get cracking on this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274326.jpg">

11. Diabetes cure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274327.jpg">

12. I read about scientists in MIT and Japan working on a machine that records your dreams and allows them to be played back. I would love something like that because I have some pretty crazy dreams that I would love to experience again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274328.jpg">

13. A time machine. Not one that physically allowed you to travel through time but something that allowed you to watch the history of the universe as its own kinda movie.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274330.jpg">

14. A long-distance space shuttle, or maybe colonization of distant worlds. I always dreamed of traveling space-side.

15. Full dive VR.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274334.jpeg">

16. A proper sci fi scanning device. Currently, the best thing we have is an MRI machine. This requires massive amounts of finite liquid helium, massive magnets, and they take up a huge amount of space. Even with that, they cannot distinguish one tissue from another, only densities so some things are missed. I would love to see a machine like the scanning pods in Passengers that can diagnose any issue.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274335.jpeg">

19. Warp drive.

20. Teleporting water from floods to droughts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274339.jpg">

21. Cure for age-related deafness/tinnitus.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274323.jpg">

22. Proper treatment regimens for fibromyalgia. All my doctors I’ve seen just toss medications at me until something helps.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87274340.jpg">

23. Immortality. That way it would be in everyone's lifetime.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">25 Leonardo da Vinci Facts Hidden By History</a>
1. Leonardo Da Vinci saved 13,000+ pages of notes and drawings on anatomy, physiology, engineering, mechanics, geometry, mathematics, bird flight, flying machines, botany, proportions, topology, weaponry, musical instruments, art, and more, all in mirrored shorthand written from right to left.-u/wjbc
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255172.jpg">

2. Leonardo da Vinci designed a robotic knight operated by cables. When modern engineers built a replica based on the designs, it was functional.-u/ThePinkTeenager
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255173.png">

3. Leonardo Da Vinci's "The Last Supper" as it exists today is largely a modern reconstruction. The painting was already severely deteriorated within sixty years of being painted, and has since suffered flooding, bombing, French revolutionaries, a scratchy curtain and use as a prison cell.-u/Nihil-Novi
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255174.png">

4. Leonardo Da Vinci and Niccolo Machiavelli once plotted to steal the Arno River from Pisa when the city was at war with Florence.-u/video-kid
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255175.png">

5. Leonardo da Vinci wrote “all the branches of a tree at every stage of its height when put together are equal in thickness to the trunk”. In 2011 Christophe Eloy investigated and found that trees that followed Leonardo's rule would be the best at resisting wind-induced fracture.-u/jamescookenotthatone
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255176.jpg">

6. Leonardo Da Vinci fully intended for his works to be published and left them to his pupil, who couldn't get through the writing and only managed to compile a treatise on painting in his lifetime, with the rest of his papers sold off by disinterested heirs.-deleted user
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255177.jpg">

7. Leonardo Da Vinci only slept 20 minutes every 4 hours.-u/embrujo99
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255178.png">

8. Ginevra de Benci is the only Leonardo da Vinci painting to be located in the Western Hemisphere (in Washington DC).-u/GPFlag_Guy1
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255179.jpg">

9. Leonardo da Vinci never had a last name because he was born out of wedlock, thus leading to his “last name” being da Vinci (of Vinci) because the town he was born in was called Vinci.-deleted user
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255180.jpg">

10. Leonardo Da Vinci once conducted an experiment to understand the flow of blood through the valves of the heart, by pouring hot wax into one, making a mold of thin glass from the cast, and then pumping water mixed with seeds through it. He saw how a heart actually regulates itself.-u/Tokyono
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255181.jpg">

11. Leonardo da Vinci's "Salvator Mundi" was sold at auction in 1958 for £45, and again in 2005 for under $10,000. In 2011, it was authenticated as a Leonardo original. It was then sold in 2013 for $75 million, sold again for $127.5 million, and later sold at auction in 2017 for $450.3 million.-u/malalatargaryen
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255182.png">

12. The most expensive manuscript in existence is the Codex Leicester, a notebook written by Leonardo Da Vinci. When adjusted for inflation, it is worth $53 million and is currently owned by Bill Gates.-u/famously_decent
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255183.jpg">

13. Adoration Of The Magi is an unfinished work by Leonardo da Vinci commissioned by a Florentine monastery in 1480. Consistent with his proneness to abandon projects, he eventually grew bored with it, simply left, and moved to Milan. The monastery paid Filippino Lippi to complete it instead.-u/SojourningCPA
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255184.jpg">

14. Leonardo da Vinci was a wedding planner before becoming famous as a painter. The Last Supper's table layout was originally a layout he designed for the Duke of Milan's 1491 wedding.-u/TBTabby
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87255185.jpg">
