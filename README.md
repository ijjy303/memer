## <a href="#link4" id="link3">20 Fascinating Photos Collected From History</a>
1. John Dillinger, center, handcuffed to Deputy Sheriff R.M. Pierce during Dillinger’s murder trial hearing in Crown Point, Indiana. Though his trial was scheduled for March 12, 1934, Dillinger would escape from the Crown Point prison on March 3.

The best-known American bank robber of the 20th century was John Dillinger. Although his career lasted only a little more than a year from June 1933 to July 1934 he gained nationwide notoriety as the country’s most wanted criminal.
Dillinger was born in Indianapolis, Ind., on June 28, 1902. He grew up there and in nearby Mooresville. In 1923 he joined the United States Navy but deserted the service within a few months. He reappeared in Mooresville on Sept. 6, 1924, and was caught robbing a store. He served time in Indiana prisons until 1933, becoming a hardened criminal.
Paroled in May 1933, Dillinger formed a gang and set out to rob banks. Captured four months later, he was rescued by gang members. After robberies in several states, he was arrested in Arizona and returned to Indiana and jailed. He executed a remarkable escape on Mar. 3, 1934, and continued his bank robberies. The object of a massive manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), he was so legend says lured to the Biograph Theater in Chicago on July 22, 1934, by Anna Sage, the mysterious so-called Lady in Red. There FBI agents gunned him down.

Many Japanese were extremely offended by this picture because of how casual MacArthur is looking and standing while next to the Emperor, who was supposed to be a god.
The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur under the grounds that it damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it.

19. Rasputin and groupies. Gorokhovo street flat, Saint Petersburg, 1914.

Who was Rasputin and what was his influence?
Rasputin was a religious mystic and faith healer. The heir to the Russian thrown had hemophilia, which at the time was poorly understood and potentially very dangerous. Rasputin was able to stop his bleeding, either by using hypnosis or giving him aspirin. This gave him access to the royal family and influence with the Russian Empress.
During WWI Rasputin prophesied that Russian forces would not be victorious until the Emperor personally led them. This did not go well. Rasputin was later assassinated for unclear reason. He famously took a long time to die and survived through several methods of murder.
