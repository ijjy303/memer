## <a href="#link4" id="link3">50 Bikers Escort Bullied Boy To First Day of Middle School</a>
1. Eleven-year-old Phil Mick was nervous to start his first day of sixth grade.

According to his mom, Tammy Mick of Auburn, Indiana, Phil had confessed that he didn't want to return to class after being bullied during his final year of elementary school.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2414570/85438882.jpg">

2. "He was hiding it," Tammy Mick told ABC News. "He came home with bumps and bruises. He said he wanted to end his life and I stepped up as parent and tried to get things taken care of."

On Tuesday, Phil showed up for class with 50 bikers on motorcycles behind him, to escort Phil Mick to his first day of middle school on Aug. 1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2414570/85438885.jpg">

3. Phil Mick, 11, got a special ride on the back of the motorcycle of Brett Warfield, sales manager of KDZ Motorcycle Sales & Service, on his way to school.

Brent Warfield, sales manager of KDZ Motorcycle Sales & Service and a mutual friend of the Mick family, decided to step in and help after hearing about Phil's situation.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2414570/85438881.jpg">

4. "When you hear an 11-year-old-kid talking about getting kicked and picked on all because they don't have as much money or wear nice clothes, being overweight and then having an 11-year-old son myself, it reached down deep and hit me," he said.

Warfield put a call out on Facebook for bikers to join him in escorting Phil to school on Aug. 1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2414570/85438883.jpg">

5. "It gave him confidence," he explained. "The middle school is a fresh start for him. I've talked to him several days since. He goes to school happy, comes home happy."

Mick said she'd like to encourage kids who are being bullied to share it with a loved one.

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Girl Isn't Sure What Her Mom Got Her For Christmas</a>
1. Twitter user Shoobert Doobert received a present from her mom on Christmas but after opening said present, she was shocked to find out that her mom had the courage to purchase her daughter a pink dildo. It's a little personal, but hey, some mom's like to be really involved in their children's sexual growth.

Frankly, once you get a look at it, the thing looks like it's a mix of 80's nostalgia and Blade Runner.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85230349.jpg">

2. Yeah, that looks like a filthy dildo alright.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85230350.png">

3. However upon further inspection (inspection meaning just turning it over), Shoobert realized her mom got her a damn cup holder/handle for her Yeti cup. You can call it a Freudian slip, but there's no denying that it looked like a dildo at first.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85230351.jpg">

4. Shoobert posted her before and after thoughts onto Twitter which received over 80,000 retweets. And you wonder why people get into porn. Whether it's funny or overtly sexual in nature, one can't help but stop to look (and sometimes share!)
