## <a href="#link6" id="link5">17 Famous Ghosts Pictures That Can't Be Explained</a>
1. Child at the Railroad Crossing. Several children were killed at a railroad crossing located in San Antonia, Texas. Locals will tell you that their ghosts still linger at the spot, and will push idle cars across the track – even though the path is uphill.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787043.jpg">

2. Freddy Jackson. A squadron of the Royal Air Force assembled to take a mundane photograph, but after the picture was developed the squad quickly realized that this was no ordinary picture. Standing behind one of his mates was the two days deceased Freddy Jackson. He had been working when he was killed in a freak-accident by an air plane propeller. Several of the other men in the photo confirmed that it was in fact Jackson’s face in the background of the picture.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787044.jpg">

3. The Madonna of Bachelor’s Grove. Bachelor’s Grove Cemetery, located in Illinois, is considered to be one of the most haunted places in the world. This picture depicts a lady resting on a bench, but there wasn’t anyone else in the cemetery at the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/936748/84787045.jpg">

4. Back Seat Driver. This famous ghost photograph was taken in 1959 by Mable Chinnery. After visiting the grave of her mother, Mable turned and took a picture of her husband, who was waiting for her in the car.
