1. I put a tiny piece of masking tape over my co-worker’s mouse laser on April fool’s day one year, wrote “April fool’s” on it. He troubleshot every single thing except examining the mouse. He eventually called IT who simply turned the mouse over and pointed it out to him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87299013.jpg">

8. When I was a corrections officer we had a guy who worked with us who was kind of a d**k to everyone, and he was computer illiterate. We took a screenshot of his desktop and moved all of his icons off of it so it looked legit but nothing worked. It took him an hour before he finally called IT and they figured it out pretty quickly. He wouldn’t talk to any of us for about a week.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87299021.jpg">

12. Whenever I visit my extended family across the country, I bring a bag full of random remotes that I don’t use anymore. Just random remotes that go to old dvrs or anything really. Just hide them around their house, they only recently caught on.

13. The movie theater in my town is usually mostly empty. There's been a couple of times when I've come in to get seated and there's literally only one other person in my auditorium.There's an evil part of me that wants to just go sit right next to them. Not illegal, but it should be.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87299025.jpg">
