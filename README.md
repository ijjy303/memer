## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Couple Finds Hidden Treasure In New House</a>
1. While moving all their stuff into their new house, Matt stacked some boxes into an empty closet, not paying much attention to the floor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089448.jpg">

2. While Matt was pretty oblivious to the secret hiding under the cardboard boxes, his wife noticed a panel in the floor and said to him, "Did you know we had a trapdoor?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089449.jpg">

3. Super curious, they quickly moved the boxes out of the way and Matt tried the handle...hoping not to find any dead bodies below.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089450.jpg">

4. The trapdoor opened easy but it looked like there was nothing but dust to be found down there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089451.jpg">

5. But wait...what's that hiding in the corner?!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089452.jpg">

6. A box!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089453.jpg">

7. This intricate little box was sitting on plastic sheeting.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089454.jpg">

8. They tried to open it only to realize it was locked tight. Not having any idea how old and delicate it was they decided not to force it open and risk ruining the box itself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089455.jpg">

9. It was surprisingly heavy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089456.jpg">

10. Since the keyhole appeared to be intact, Matt decided to leave the box and call up a locksmith friend for help.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089457.jpg">

11. Here's a close-up of the keyhole.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089458.jpg">

12. After finding out his locksmith friend wasn't coming to explore the unopened box, overly curious Matt decided he had to try to force it open and see what was hiding inside. He grabbed his tools and got to work!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089459.jpg">

13. Using a screwdriver and a hammer, Matt got the box open in no time at all.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041457/85261674/3.jpg">

14. Oh wow! It was a little treasure chest!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089460.jpg">

15. What excited Matt and his wife the most was when they found a tiny box within the bigger one.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089461.jpg">

16. This probably explains why the thing was so heavy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089462.jpg">

17. Here's a close-up of some of the coins, including a British 50 pence coin.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089463.jpg">

18. Some of the coins appeared to be very old, and on closer inspection...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089464.jpg">

19. ...yes, they were old! This one was over 130 years old!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089465.jpg">

20. This one cent coin was incredibly from 1859.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089466.jpg">

21. Most of the coins were American, but there were some from all corners of the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089467.jpg">

22. While looking through the coins, Matt's wife spotted something else...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089468.jpg">

23. It was this awesome retro Silver Surfer card in a protective case.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041520/85261676/1.jpg">

24. While the coins and card were cool, there was something else in there...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041509/85261675/2.jpg">

25. ...that other tiny box!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089469.jpg">

26. What's that? Seems like this box had been outfitted with some serious tiny-lock technology.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089470.jpg">

27. Luckily, Matt's wife found the key among all the coins...

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089474.jpg">

31. It looked like two of the three watches were still functioning.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089475.jpg">

32. This ring with the old Girl Scout logo was also in the tiny box.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">16 Mistakes Spotted In Disney Movies</a>
1. Monsters Inc. premiered in 2001 to prove monsters are not always scary and, apparently, to show scratches disappear.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87309138.jpg">

2. Frozen is clearly one of the most beloved and blockbuster movies of recent times, but it has some small mistakes. There is a scene in which Anna and Kristoff fall with a rope tied around their waists; however, in the next scene, it’s nowhere to be found.
