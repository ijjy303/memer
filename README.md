## <a href="#link7" id="link6">25 Real Life Cheat Codes That Actually Work</a>
1. If you gently rock back and forth while pooping, it will take significantly less time and make it easier to pass more "troublesome" movements.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286784.jpg">

2. Can't find your car in a parking lot? Hitting the lock button trying to get it to beep? Extend the distance of key-less entry by putting the key under your chin. The signal will resonate in your skull, increasing the range dramatically. This works, and is safe because the radiation is non-ionizing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286804.jpg">

3. To get through tech support quickly with an ISP, choose the option for becoming a new customer. Then when you get there ask to transfer to tech support. Usually they won't put you on hold because they see the number coming from the new customer line.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286793.jpg">

4. When you're giving a presentation, bring a bottle of water up to the podium. If you find yourself in a spot where you blank, taking a drink will allow you to gather your thoughts. Nobody will be the wiser.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286778.jpg">

5. Buy things out of season, this can save you money. Unless its food, then buy it in season.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286776.jpg">

6. Secretaries, tech support and janitors are the true power in office buildings. Make friends, remember birthdays and you can get anything you need or go anywhere you need.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286772.jpg">

7. The color of the twist ties on bread in the supermarket indicate which day the bread was shipped fresh to the store. Monday = Blue. Tuesday = Green. Thursday = Red. Friday = White. Saturday = Yellow.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286807.jpg">

8. Turn it off, then on again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286780.jpg">

9. If you feel uncomfortable looking into someone's eyes when they're talking to you, look at their nose instead. They cannot tell the difference.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286782.jpg">

10. When you buy something online, you usually get a chance to enter a promo code before you purchase.Google the promo codes.They're out there - you can get anything from free shipping to 25% off the purchase.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286777.jpg">

11. Shut the f**k up. Wait for the lawyer.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286775.jpg">

12. Don't hesitate to put yourself in more socially awkward situations. You will become desensitized to it, which makes you more outgoing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286790.jpg">

13. Give yourself a half hour of downtime in the morning, between being ready to leave and leaving. Your day won't feel so rushed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286792.jpg">

14. If you are quitting something like smoking or drinking, every time you feel the urge to do said addiction, go for a run, do 20 sit ups, 20 push ups etc. This way you can start to associate exercise with quitting, and you get fitter the more you quit.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286795.jpg">

15. Be friendly to everyone the first time you meet them, and smile.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286797.jpg">

16. If you get brain freeze from eating something cold too quickly, press your tongue against the roof of your mouth as hard as you can. Voila, instant brainfreeze relief.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286789.jpg">

17. If you spill any liquid that will stain your carpet, (red wine, juice, etc), pour some salt on it. Work it into the carpet with your hands, leave it there for a few hours, and vacuum it out. Voila, stain gone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286798.jpg">

18. At the end of your shower, turn the water really cold. This will wake you up and get blood flowing. It also closes your pores to allow for less dirt and bacteria to get in to help reduce acne problems.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286800.jpg">

19. When studying arts at university, take notes on your prof's political/philosophical ideologies and world views. Regurgitate these in essays and on exams for an A grade. Also, margins, font, font size, etc. are incredibly important. Never neglect these.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286801.jpg">

20. Peel a banana from the bottom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286805.jpg">

21. Baby wipes for the bathroom. Seriously, your life will be +1.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286806.jpg">

22. Avoid forgetting something in the morning by placing it in your shoes. (Works best if you wear the same pair every day.)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286785.jpg">

23. Cut negative people out of your life.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286781.jpg">

24. If you are driving an unfamiliar car and you don't know which side the gas tank is on, just look at the little pump icon next to the gas gauge on the dashboard. The pump handle on the icon will be on the side of the tank.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87286794.jpg">

25. Gently work an orange in your hands to loosen the peel from the fruit. This makes it easy enough to get the whole peel in one shot.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Dangerous Old Toys Kids Were Actually Allowed To Play With</a>
1. The Gilbert Glass Blowing Set. Keep in mind that in order to be able to change the shape of the glass, first it has to reach its softening point, which is around 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The Gilbert Glass Blowing Set encouraged children to try this with their bare hands in order to carry out a series of wildly irresponsible experiments. Where were the parents? In the ER probably.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409080.jpg">

2. Gilbert’s Kaster Kit Jr. Wow, Gilbert must've hated kids.  Gilbert MOLTEN LEAD Casting Kit allowed you to create your own army of tiny metallic minions; which sounds kinda awesome until you realize it involved casting them from molten lead by yourself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409081.jpg">

3. Stevens' Model Dockyard Locomotive. In 1843, realizing that boys might want a toy train that did more than just sit there, the Stevens Company created the Model Dockyard Locomotive, one of the first ones that actually moved. Of course, the main reason why toy trains didn’t move up to that point was simply that the technology didn’t exist. The Model Dockyard Locomotive got around that limitation by using a real steam-propelled engine that required kids to pour either kerosene or alcohol into the train and then light it. Yup, nothing like setting your toy on fire...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409082.jpg">

4. Powermite Working Power Tools were real power-tools just smaller; like that made it alright for kids to play with a drill...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409083.jpg">

5. Working toy ovens, irons and more. Yeah, the burn marks on that toy pretty much say it all. That’s an electric toy stove from the 1930s or ’40s that could actually be plugged in and heated up, which isn’t just dangerous, it’s also completely pointless. What are you supposed to heat in there? Some peanuts?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409084.jpg">

6. Gilber Chemistry Set. Oh no, Gilbert is back. This may look like a pretty safe science kit, but among the 56 chemicals included in the Gilbert chemistry set was some potentially deadly stuff. Like potassium permanganate, which, besides being poisonous, has been known to make things catch fire. Or ammonium nitrate, the same chemical that the U.S. wants to regulate now because it’s used in homemade bombs. All that came in the same box — at no point in history has being a young nerd on his birthday been so dangerous. The manual itself taught kids how to create explosions with gunpowder — on the first page — and the sole safety feature consisted of a single line telling them not to attempt the same experiment on a larger scale... which only served the purpose of informing kids that this was a possibility.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409085.jpg">

7. Austin Magic Pistol. Was there a loaded spring in there or something? Nope, the balls were fired by mixing “magic crystals” and water in the back of the gun — and by “magic crystals” they really meant “dangerous chemicals,” of course. Calcium carbide is on all kinds of hazardous materials lists because when it comes into contact with liquid, it forms a flammable gas. This isn’t some unforeseen side effect the makers of this toy could have never predicted — it’s exactly how those freaking balls were fired. There was a literal explosion happening in the back of the toy gun every time your gentle child fingers pressed the trigger, which would launch the ball up to 70 feet away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85409086.jpg">

8. Atomic Energy Lab. Atomic Energy Lab kit produced by the American Basic Science Club came with real samples of uranium (which is radioactive) and radium (which is a million times more radioactive than uranium). Since the mere presence of radioactive material in a children’s product clearly wasn’t insane enough, some of the experiments detailed in the manual also required kids to handle blocks of dry ice. Dry ice, by the way, has a temperature of minus 109.3 degrees Fahrenheit, and it’s recommended that it only be handled while wearing gloves; were gloves included? No such luck.
