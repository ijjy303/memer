## <a href="#link1" id="link0">This Girl’s Brag On Facebook Ended Up Costing Her Family $80,000</a>
1. Most social media users are aware that the things you post can come back to haunt you. They don't disappear, and they're difficult to take back, as anyone who's posted sensitive information or an inflammatory opinion knows.But in the instance of Dana Snay and her family, her bragging on social media (standard behavior for many kids her age) ended up having very real effects that cost her family a staggering amount of money.

See how her questionable judgment became a legal matter below…

2. These are Dana's parents. Her dad was the headmaster at a prestigious prep school (Gulliver Prep) in Miami, and wanted to continue to work until the age of 69, but the school decided not to renew his contract.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202401.jpg">

3. He sued the school, claiming that the decision was based on his age, which is illegal. The courts agreed and awarded him not only an $80,000 payout, but an additional $60,000 for his attorney and $10,000 in back pay.

4. His daughter, Dana, had attended Gulliver herself and attended Boston College after graduating.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202403.jpg">

5. She was an accomplished student, but what she did as a result of the settlement demonstrates a certain shortsightedness that many kids have. Only this decision would have effects more profound than most.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202404.jpg">

6. Included in the father's award was a confidentiality clause, which keeps both parties from publicly disclosing the terms of the awards, settlement or transaction. It's pretty standard language that keeps a private dispute from becoming public, even after it's resolved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202405.jpg">

7. Mr. Snay was aware of the terms of the settlement and abided by them. That included even the general outcome of the dispute, not just dollar amounts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202406.jpg">

8. It's not clear if Dana was familiar with the language in the settlement. One would assume she wasn't, because what she did next was a pretty clear violation of the terms. She took to Facebook and bluntly posted on her wall, "Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202407.jpg">

9. As though that wasn't flagrant enough, she cracked a joke about the settlement paying for her trip to Europe. Not exactly smart or classy, but kids do these types of things. She posted, "Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT."It didn’t take long for the school’s lawyers to learn that she was discussing things that she was legally bound from discussing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202408.jpg">

10. The court didn't hesitate to reverse the decision after what they deemed to be a clear breach of the terms. The judge of the case wrote, "His daughter then did precisely what the confidentiality agreement was designed to prevent."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85202409.jpg">

11. So with a couple innocuous (if not tasteless) online comments, the Snay family was out their entire settlement. Fortunately, he's found new employment, but that surely didn't stop the fallout from his daughter's thoughtless comments from stinging!

## <a href="#link2" id="link1">22 Fascinating Photos Collected From History</a>
1. Robert McGee, scalped as a child by Sioux Chief Little Turtle in 1864.

Although the custom of “scalping” was once practiced in Europe and Asia, it is generally associated with North American native groups. In scalping, the skin around the crown of the head was cut and removed from the enemy’s skull, usually causing death. In addition to its value as a war trophy, a scalp was often believed to bestow the possessor with the powers of the scalped enemy. In their early wars with Native Americans, European colonists of North America retaliated against hostile native groups by adopting their practice of scalp taking. Bounties were offered for them by colonial authorities, which in turn led to an escalation of intertribal warfare and scalping in North America.

2. Adolf Hitler informs Czech President Emil Hácha of the imminent German invasion of Czechoslovakia on March 15, 1939 in Berlin. Hácha suffered a heart attack during the meeting, and had to be kept awake by medical staff, eventually giving in and accepting Hitler’s surrender terms.

In the evening of 14 March 1939, Hitler invited President Hácha to the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. Hitler deliberately kept him waiting for hours, while Hitler watched a film. Finally, at 1:30 a.m., on 15 March 1939, Hitler saw the President. He told Hácha that as they were speaking, the German army was about to invade Czechoslovakia. All of Czechoslovakia’s defences were now under German control following the Munich Agreement in September of the previous year. The country was virtually surrounded by Germany on three fronts.
Hitler now gave the President two options: cooperate with Germany, in which case the “entry of German troops would take place in a tolerable manner” and “permit Czechoslovakia a generous life of her own, autonomy and a degree of national freedom…” or face a scenario in which “resistance would be broken by force of arms, using all means.” By four o’clock, after suffering a heart attack induced by Göring’s threat to bomb the capital, Hácha contacted Prague, effectively “signing Czechoslovakia away” to Germany. French Ambassador Robert Coulondre reported that by half past four, Hácha was “in a state of total collapse, and kept going only by means of injections.”

11. The Allied crossing of the St Quentin Canal in 1918. 

The photo shows General J V Campbell on Riqueval Bridge, addressing men of the 46th North Midland Division following their successful assault of the St Quentin Canal on 29th September 1918.
At this point, the canal flowed through a 50 feet deep cutting, the east bank of which, the Germans had fortified with emplaced machine guns, barbed wire and bunkers. It was a strongpoint of the German Hindenburg Line which they considered impregnable. The British decision to attack it was made at the last minute and was intended to divert German attention from another assault taking place further north which involved greener Allied troops.
The morning of the assault was very misty which provided cover to the attacking troops but made it difficult descending to the canal. The Germans, aware of the impending assault, swept the western bank with pre-sighted fire.
Despite this, the assaulting troops used ropes to lower themselves down the bank where they had to cut through barbed wire to reach the canal. Here they used collapsible boats and life preservers to swarm to the other bank before having to attack up a near vertical face in the face of furious German resistances.
At the same time, a company strength, forlorn hope rushed the bridge in the photo. They had to clamber through coils of barbed wire with little cover beyond the bridge parapet. They managed to drive off the German engineers before they were able to fire the explosives already placed along the roadway.
The bridge and bank were both carried and the impregnable Hindenburg Line was breached at this point.

20. The Quartermaster Corps (QMC) of the United States Army begins training dogs for the newly established War Dog Program, or “K-9 Corps.” 1942.

The K-9 Corps initially accepted over 30 breeds of dogs, but the list was soon narrowed to seven: German Shepherds, Belgian sheep dogs, Doberman Pinschers, collies, Siberian Huskies, Malumutes and Eskimo dogs. Members of the K-9 Corps were trained for a total of 8 to 12 weeks. After basic obedience training, they were sent through one of four specialized programs to prepare them for work as sentry dogs, scout or patrol dogs, messenger dogs or mine-detection dogs. In active combat duty, scout dogs proved especially essential by alerting patrols to the approach of the enemy and preventing surprise attacks. – The top canine hero of World War II was Chips, a German Shepherd who served with the Army’s 3rd Infantry Division. Trained as a sentry dog, Chips broke away from his handlers and attacked an enemy machine gun nest in Italy, forcing the entire crew to surrender. The wounded Chips was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star and the Purple Heart–all of which were later revoked due to an Army policy preventing official commendation of animals.

22. Adolf Hitler in 1915, 1916, 1919, 1921.

In 1918 a British soldier allegedly spares the life of an injured Adolf Hitler in World War 1 – Private Henry Tandey, a British soldier serving near the French village of Marcoing, reportedly encounters a wounded German soldier and declines to shoot him, sparing the life of 29-year-old Lance Corporal Adolf Hitler. –
As Tandey later told sources, during the final moments of that battle, as the German troops were in retreat, a wounded German soldier entered Tandey’s line of fire. “I took aim but couldn’t shoot a wounded man,” Tandey remembered, “so I let him go.” The German soldier nodded in thanks, and disappeared. –
Though sources do not exist to prove the exact whereabouts of Adolf Hitler on that day in 1918, an intriguing link emerged to suggest that he was in fact the soldier Tandey spared. A photograph that appeared in London newspapers of Tandey carrying a wounded soldier at Ypres in 1914 was later portrayed on canvas in a painting by the Italian artist Fortunino Matania glorifying the Allied war effort. As the story goes, when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain traveled to Germany in 1938 to engage Hitler in a last-ditch effort to avoid another war in Europe, he was taken by the führer to his new country retreat in Bavaria. There, Hitler showed Chamberlain his copy of the Matania painting, commenting, “That’s the man who nearly shot me.”
