## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Girl Isn't Sure What Her Mom Got Her For Christmas</a>
1. Twitter user Shoobert Doobert received a present from her mom on Christmas but after opening said present, she was shocked to find out that her mom had the courage to purchase her daughter a pink dildo. It's a little personal, but hey, some mom's like to be really involved in their children's sexual growth.

Frankly, once you get a look at it, the thing looks like it's a mix of 80's nostalgia and Blade Runner.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85230349.jpg">

2. Yeah, that looks like a filthy dildo alright.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85230350.png">

3. However upon further inspection (inspection meaning just turning it over), Shoobert realized her mom got her a damn cup holder/handle for her Yeti cup. You can call it a Freudian slip, but there's no denying that it looked like a dildo at first.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85230351.jpg">

4. Shoobert posted her before and after thoughts onto Twitter which received over 80,000 retweets. And you wonder why people get into porn. Whether it's funny or overtly sexual in nature, one can't help but stop to look (and sometimes share!)

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">Woman Quits Job To Breastfeed Boyfriend</a>
1. Mulford reportedly took time off from her bartending job so she could focus on feeding her boyfriend every two hours.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049659.jpg">

2. Technically speaking she’s not feeding him yet, as she predicts it will take two months to get her maids a milking, but they’re already practicing with “dry feeding” which is exactly as creepy as it sounds.

How did we get to this point?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049660.jpg">

3. She was single and became interested in Adult Breastfeeding Relationships (ABR) after reading about them and getting jealous of the bond breastfeeding can create between two people who aren't related.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049661.jpg">

4. She started searching for men who would be open to the idea of adult breastfeeding, but feared she might “never get to try adult breastfeeding.”And what a shame that would be.But don’t worry, guys! She found a latch match!Meet Brad, an old boyfriend from school, who when they were talking brought up the fact he was a breast man, giving Mulford a window of opportunity.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049662.jpg">

5. Brad crashed right through that window, even doing his own research, and Mulford said she knew she had “found a partner for life.”

“We both wanted the same thing out of the relationship – a magical bond that only breastfeeding can achieve,” she said. “I’ve taken a break from my job because I want to devote everything to making this work.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049663.jpg">

6. In addition to her "pumping," she drinks Mother's Milk tea three times a day, takes an herbal pill, Lactiful, and eats oatmeal as well as flax seeds in order to increase her milk supply.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049664.jpg">

7. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no...They even set an alarm so they can “feed” during the night.

“Nights have been a struggle because Brad sleeps so peacefully but we manage to cope – until he falls asleep latched onto me, which is beautiful,” she admitted.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049665.gif">

8. The couple hope to get married in the near future, but they have ruled out having any children together (probably because she can't produce enough milk for anyone else).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049666.jpg">

9. And there’s an added bonus for Brad, who as a self-confessed “gym buff,” is excited about the health benefits he’ll receive from Jennifer’s milk.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049667.jpg">

10. “He is a real alpha male," she said, "but behind closed doors this relationship lets him put his guard down, be submissive and allow himself to be loved 100 percent.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049668.jpg">

11. I’m sure that will go over real well with the guys at the gym. Do you even latch, bro?

At any rate, she draws the line at doing it in public because it’s very private for her except when it’s plastered all over the Internet.

“I’ll never say never but I love the time we spend nursing alone,” she said. “It’s our time away from the rest of the world and I look forward to every feed.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049669.jpg">

12.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049670.jpg">

13. I imagine she’s the one who makes the coffee in the morning — or at least supplies the creamer.
