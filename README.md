6. English archaeologist Howard Carter entered the sealed burial chamber of King Tutankhamen 1923.

Curse of the Tutankhamun?
The first of the “mysterious” deaths was that of Lord Carnarvon. He had been bitten by a mosquito, and later slashed the bite accidentally while shaving. It became infected and blood poisoning resulted. …
Skeptics have pointed out that many others who visited the tomb or helped to discover it lived long and healthy lives. A study showed that of the 58 people who were present when the tomb and sarcophagus were opened, only eight died within a dozen years. All the others were still alive, including Howard Carter, who died of lymphoma in 1939 at the age of 64. The last survivor, American archaeologist J.O. Kinnaman, died in 1961, a full 39 years after the event.

7. General Dwight D. Eisenhower addresses American paratroopers prior to D-Day.

Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen of the Allied Expeditionary Forces:
You are about to embark upon the Great Crusade, toward which we have striven these many months. The eyes of the world are upon you. The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving people everywhere march with you. In company with our brave Allies and brothers-in-arms on other Fronts you will bring about the destruction of the German war machine, the elimination of Nazi tyranny over oppressed peoples of Europe, and security for ourselves in a free world.
Your task will not be an easy one. Your enemy is well trained, well equipped and battle-hardened. He will fight savagely.
But this is the year 1944. Much has happened since the Nazi triumphs of 1940-41. The United Nations have inflicted upon the Germans great defeats, in open battle, man-to-man. Our air offensive has seriously reduced their strength in the air and their capacity to wage war on the ground. Our Home Fronts have given us an overwhelming superiority in weapons and munitions of war, and placed at our disposal great reserves of trained fighting men. The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory.
I have full confidence in your courage, devotion to duty, and skill in battle. We will accept nothing less than full victory.
Good Luck! And let us all beseech the blessing of Almighty God upon this great and noble undertaking

This photo was taken in July 1913 by French photographer Albert Kahn. Albert Kahn was a millionaire banker who pioneered color photography using the process invented by the Lumière brothers. During his trip through exotic countries, Albert Kahn visited Mongolia where he took this picture of a woman who was condemned to slow and painful starvation by being deposited in a remote desert inside a wooden crate that was to become her tomb. Initially the bowls on the ground had water in it, though was not intentionally refilled, and the person inside was allowed to beg for food which often just prolonged their suffering as they generally didn’t get enough food for the passersby. The photographer had to leave her in the box because it would be against a prime directive of anthropologists to intervene in another cultures law and order system.

Secondly, when you have done that, I am prepared to discuss with you the implications of your surrender: how we will dispose of those surrendered troops, how we will occupy the surrendered territory, how we will deal with the civilians, and so forth. And my third point: If you do not agree to Point 1, the surrender, then I will go on with the war and I will be delighted to do so.” Monty added, as an after-thought, “All your soldiers and civilians may be killed.”

1. Dollar stores have aisles filled with inexpensive toys promising to give hours of entertainment.They can be a gold mine for awesome presents, or in this case can be something more sinister.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093372.jpg">

2. This pink wand looks harmless enough, though it is called an Evil Stick.The packaging has an anime character and snowflakes. It looks more like a princess wand in the shape of a flower than something dark and evil.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093373.jpg">

3. One mom in Dayton, Ohio purchased this toy for her toddler. She didn't put much thought on the image behind the mirror-looking sticker.Nicole Allen picked the wand sitting among Barbies and baby toys.

4. The photo in the package promises that a unicorn will be revealed when the sticker is peeled off.It is definitely not a unicorn or a magical being that appears. It's something much more sinister not suitable for young children.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85093375.jpg">

5. The packaging also confirms that "wonderful music" will be played at the touch of a button.In reality, it plays a cackling laugh and lights up when turned on.
