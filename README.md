## <a href="#link2" id="link1">Gamer Finds Craigslist Gold!</a>
1. "I had an Amiga 2000 HD back in college in the early 90s and was hoping to find a small Amiga to use again. This was advertised as two Amiga 500 computers, a monitor and some accessories so I went and picked it up.  Was surprised that the computers and monitor were boxed. Here is a snap of everything loaded into my car."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361862.jpg">

2. "Starting to sort through the stuff. Came with some boxed games and various discs."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361863.jpg">

3. More manuals and floppies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361864.jpg">

4. Even more manuals - "there are more Amiga manuals than there are computers."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361865.jpg">

5. Various floppies including originals of some Sierra games.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361866.jpg">

7. "Interesting. Haven't looked at what is on these yet..."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361868.jpg">

8. "Some more stuff. Two Amiga floppies and a generic external drive. Boxed joystick and a funny 3rd party mouse. Also, two unopened boxes of floppies."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361869.jpg">

9. "WHISPER QUIET LOL"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361870.jpg">

10.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361871.jpg">

11. Can this packaging get any more 80's?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361872.jpg">

12. "These were just lose inside the box. I had the second from the right joystick here -- and it sucked. Cramped up my hand after playing for a little while."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361873.jpg">

13. Amiga Genlock device for overlaying Amiga graphics on top of live video and the Amiga 520 RF modulator.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361876.jpg">

16. Random 40 meg Quantum drive included in the box.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361877.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361878.jpg">

18. First Amiga. Power supply and mouse.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361879.jpg">

19. "In great shape!! Just a little dirty and keys look pretty much brand new."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361880.jpg">

20. Second Amiga, also in great shape. Needs a minor clean only.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361881.jpg">

21. One is slightly more yellowed than the other for some reason.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361882.jpg">

22. "Mitsubishi Multisync monitor AUM-1381A. Need a little bit of a clean but in great shape otherwise. Has a Tilt-Swivel stand in the box which I need to install."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361883.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361885.jpg">

25. "Testing it with my Tandy 1000 EX. Works great with CGA. Reading the review from PC Magazine, it also supports EGA and Monochrome. It can support up to 800x560 resolution so I think it might do VGA too. (Will need to make a new cable.)"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361886.jpg">

26. "Hooked up to the first Amiga. Kickstart 1.3. This machine has 1 meg of RAM. Need to check the trap door to see why the clock isn't there."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361887.jpg">

27. Second Amiga is Kickstart 2.0 and has 1 meg of RAM and a real time clock.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361888.jpg">

28. "Monitor is all cleaned up. I tested this monitor with CGA, EGA, MDA (Monochrome) and Amiga 15khz analog video. All work perfectly! I found some info on it and it also supports 31.5khz VGA (640x480.) It is a real jack of all trades!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361889.jpg">

29. "Inside, it is super clean. It is very odd that the monitor is quite dim for some reason, even at max brightness. Doesn't appear to have many hours of run-time on it. I adjusted the G1 and G2 controls along with sub brightness and R/G/B cut pots. It made a huge difference now."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361890.jpg">

30. "Trying out some random games it came with. Monitor is looking nice now I adjusted it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361891.jpg">

31. "Even under my bright shop lights it is decently bright. If I turn it up more than this it loses a little sharpness in the center from some minor blooming. Considering the age of this monitor and the unknown history, it's in amazing shape. Not a scratch or nick on it."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361892.jpg">

32. "I have the original Deluxe Paint III floppies including the art disc. It was a real nostalgic blast to look at the old classic files like Venus and King Tut."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361893.jpg">

33. "Opening up the computer with the non working clock, it has the Commodore A501 RAM+clock board. It is encased in metal shielding so I cut that away to get inside."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361894.jpg">

34. Yep, here is your problem! Ouch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361895.jpg">

35. "The corrosion ate away a bunch of the copper but luckily it is just ground fill and one trace for the battery which doesn't do anything. I cleaned it as best I could with alcohol and a brush. Hopefully it won't corrode any more."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361896.jpg">

36. "The original battery is a rechargeable NiCD 3.6v -- so the board tries to recharge the battery when powered up. I replaced the battery with a salvaged CR2032 holder and battery and installed a diode to prevent charging of this lithium battery. The clock appears to work perfectly with the 2.9 volts it gets from this CR2032 after diode voltage drop."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361897.jpg">

37. Card installed back into the trap door compartment, without the metal shielding.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85361898.jpg">

38. "All set! Here is Kickstart 1.3 machine (with repaired A501 board) all hooked up on my workbench. Awesome! AMIGA FOREVER!"

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">25 Major Scandals Everyone Has Forgotten About</a>
1. Ticketmaster buying their own tickets to scalp out at thousands of dollars. -u/wpggloryhole
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265328.jpg">

2. Currently ongoing but nobody is saying sh*t. The Hyundai plant in Alabama has employed 50 underaged workers. Some of them are as young as 12 years old. They have these kids working shifts around the clock. Crazy that this hasn't made a.much bigger splash. -u/Ear_Enthusiast
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265329.png">

3. Those Turpin siblings that escaped being chained to their beds by their sh*tty parents? Happy ending, right? Yeah, no. Turns out their foster parents ended up abusing them even worse and now a bunch of them are suing. -u/TwoFingersWhiskey
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265330.jpg">

4. “Recycling.” You’d be amazed and disgusted at how much stuff you think you are recycling that your municipalities are shipping off to other countries just so they can dump it in the ocean for you. We know this is happening too but because we’re disconnected from it we just ignore it. -u/tibbymat
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265331.png">

5. Nurdles. Except it wasn't forgotten about, nobody cared to begin with. Nurdles are these tiny little plastic beads that companies buy as a raw material to melt down to make plastic products. If you were making plastic toys, you might buy bags of plastic "nurdles" to melt down for your molds. Anyway, some cargo containers FULL of these were lost from a ship and dumped into the Gulf Coast. It created an ecological microplastic disaster that is impossible to even attempt to clean up. Nobody really got into trouble for it. -u/sapphicsandwich
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265324.jpeg">

6. A lot of people seem to simply overlook the fact that Chris Brown beat the sh*t out of Rihanna. -u/amyjandrews
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265323.png">

7. The NYC Mayor's wife misplaced a whole lot of money and nobody seems to care. -u/irishpwr46
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265325.jpg">

8. Assassination of Haiti's president. -u/YesImThatGirl
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265326.jpg">

9. Not an overtly public or well-known scandal... but erm... where the f*ck is Shelly Miscavige? And why is no one actively investigating her disappearance? -u/JewJitsu83
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265327.jpg">

10. Wells Fargo bank opening BS accounts and submitting credit card applications on behalf of their customers....without their knowledge or consent. I'm actually a customer with them and have been for years so for all I know they did that to me, but all I ever got was a couple of emails about how they're really a good company with good people and that doesn't reflect their values or some such crap like that. I think they ended up firing a lot of people and executives who knew about it were fined millions of dollars. But I mean if the practice went that high it must have been widely known. -u/anfla56
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265332.png">

11. The FBI knew the pedophile Larry Nassar was molesting child gymnasts and allowed him to continue for years. They went so far as to falsify the testimony of the victims. No one at the FBI has been punished. Nassar was sentenced in 2017.-u/saw2239
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265322.png">

12. Airlines getting bailed out by taxpayers during a crisis and with executives still taking huge bonuses. The quality of airlines significantly deteriorated because they don’t want to compress profit by paying more to hire more and expand flight offerings again to pre-pandemic levels. -u/rpoh73189
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265333.jpg">

13. In 2016, South Korea had a political scandal in which president Park Geun-Hye was exposed for being manipulated/controlled by a cult called "The 8 Goddesses Cabal". South Korea was literally being ruled by a cult. Park was impeached. -u/YaBoyVolke
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265334.png">

14. MP Pedophile Dossier. A bunch of UK politicians were caught "borrowing" children for an orphanage for all the unspeakable things you can imagine. Another politician managed to weave himself into this circle consisting of around 20 members and took down names, dates, locations and victims. He then handed off this book to the Home Office (British CIA), who then handed it to the police, who then "lost" it. No action was taken. The case has been reopened 5 times since and each conclusion has always been "We lost the book. And we're not going to investigate it ourselves because uhh" . I think this circle is still going on and the police are being paid off to never investigate it. -u/WeakWraith
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265335.png">

15. Pilot truck stops stole around $250 million dollars from their customers. The owner was never really penalized for it and owns the Cleveland Browns. -u/cleach31

18. Boy George!! He was jailed for 15 months for imprisoning a Norwegian male escort after a nude photoshoot, in what the judge called a "premeditated, callous and humiliating" assault. He basically tortured him. And now he hosts TV shows in Australia! -u/pushingnumbers

19. That McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes? None of the big prize-winning pieces ever made it to stores. The guy in charge of ‘randomly’ putting them on cups and cartons after production kept them and gave them to friends, splitting the winnings. For YEARS. -u/AlwxWrites

20. Dupont (still active company) when producing Teflon dumped loads of bad chemicals into the water and Teflon was poisoning people all over the world giving them 6 known types of cancer. They covered it up for decades. Crazy how evil some companies are. -u/Opposite-Mediocre

23. Politicians cashing out for huge profits right before COVID was widely publicized and the stock market tanked. They made millions and millions as millions of people lost millions, and their lives. -u/tossaway69420lol

24. Cambridge Analytica. They used social media and social sciences to manipulate entire countries. They helped facilitate Brexit and cause a huge cultural divide in the U.S. I think it’s a new kind of warfare. -u/SnapDragonBlues

25. The financial crash of 2008 and how all of the individuals responsible saw little to zero consequences of their actions which destroyed global economics.
