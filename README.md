2. Adolf Hitler, Along with Mussolini’s son-in-law, Count Galeazzo Ciano (to Hitler’s right), and Joachim von Ribbentrop, attend a NSDAP (Nazi Party) 1930s.

Count Galeazzo Ciano was, from the very beginning, against the notion of Italy entering a war; he believed Italy was ill prepared for such an undertaking. As his doubts grew, Ciano would take increasingly bold actions; prior to the German invasion of France, for example, he warned the Belgian government of an imminent German invasion of Belgium. In 1942 and 1943, when the situation looked dire, Ciano turned his efforts towards Italy’s withdrawal from the conflict. For this, he was removed from his post as Foreign Minister on February 5th, 1943. He would remain under close watch of his father-in-law, Mussolini. Following Mussolini’s arrest and Italy’s change of heart, Ciano sought refuge in Germany. There he did not find it; Ciano was rebuffed by the Germans and tried by the fsacist Italians, who found him guilty of treason. Count Ciano was executed by firing squad under the order of his father in law, Benito Mussolini, on January 11th, 1944. His last words were “Long Live Italy!”

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">12 Pics That Will Make Your Emotions Peak</a>
1. Couple carries baby without brain to term, in order to donate organs.

In December, my wife Keri and I went in for the standard 19-week anatomy scan of our second child. As a parent, you think that appointment is all about finding out boy or girl, but it’s about a whole lot more. In our case, our daughter was diagnosed with a rare birth defect called anencephaly. Some three in 10,000 pregnancies rare. Congratulations to us. The phrase our doctor used in explaining it was “incompatible with life,” which looks as terrible in words as it sounds. The child fails to develop the frontal lobe of the brain, or the top of their skull. The chance of survival is literal zero percent. If you’re Googling it now — first of all, don’t click images — and see a story about a baby that has lived a lengthy time with anencephaly, either the baby doesn’t actually have anencephaly, or it’s being kept alive with every life support function possible. So we sat in a doctor’s office, five months before our daughter was set to be born, knowing she would die.

4. A 31-year-old San Antonio man, Anthony Garay, was arrested Wednesday after a relative was allegedly caught at school searching for pornography so that she could learn about what he was doing to her at night

The abuse came to light on May 16, when a teacher at Elm Creek Elementary caught one of the victims searching for pornography on a school-issued iPad, according to documents.
When the teacher asked the girl why she was searching for pornography, the child told her that she was searching for what was being done to her at night. She said Garay sexually assaults her “all the time at night” and never lets her sleep.
The teacher contacted Child Protective Services, and an investigator was sent to the school to interview the child. The girl told the investigator that Garay had sexually abused her from at least the age of 8, and that the abuse occurred in her home

6. A woman dying of cancer wrote her own obituary.

My obituary:
My name is Sonia Todd and I died of cancer at the age of 38. I decided to write my own obituary because they are usually written in a couple of different ways that I just don’t care for. Either family or friends gather together, and list every minor accomplishment from cradle to grave in a timeline format, or they try to create one poetic last stanza about someone’s life that is so glowing one would think the deceased had been the living embodiment of a deity.
I don’t like the timeline format because, let’s face it, I never really accomplished anything of note. Other than giving birth to my two wonderful, lovable, witty and amazing sons (James and Jason), marrying my gracious, understanding and precious husband (Brian), and accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior – I have done very little. None of that requires obit space that I have to shell out money for.
I also didn’t want a bunch of my friends sitting around writing a glowing report of me that we all know would be filled with fish tales, half-truths, impossible scenarios, and outright honest-to-goodness lies. I just don’t like to put people in that kind of situation.
The truth, or my version of it, is this: I just tried to do the best I could. Sometimes I succeeded, most of the time I failed, but I tried. For all of my crazy comments, jokes, and complaints, I really did love people. The only thing that separates me from anyone else is the type of sin each of us participated in. I didn’t always do the right thing or say the right thing and when you come to the end of your life those are the things you really regret, the small simple things that hurt other people.
My life was not perfect and I encountered many, many bumps in the road. I would totally scrap the years of my life from age 16 to 20 … OK, maybe 14 to 22. I think that would eradicate most of my fashion disasters and hair missteps from the ’80s. But mostly, I enjoyed life. Some parts of it were harder than others but I learned something from every bad situation and I couldn’t do any more than that.
Besides there are some benefits to dying youngish. For example, I still owe on my student loans and the joke’s on them cuz I’m not paying them. Plus, I am no longer afraid of serial killers, telemarketers, or the IRS. I don’t have to worry about wrinkles or the ozone layer and/or hide from the news during election season.
Some folks told me that writing my own obituary was morbid, but I think it is great because I get a chance to say “thank you” to all the people who helped me along the way. Those that loved me, assisted me, cared for me, laughed with me, and taught me things so that I could have a wonderful, happy life. I was blessed beyond measure by knowing all of you. That is what made my life worthwhile.
If you think of me, and would like to do something in honor of my memory, do this:
Volunteer at a school, church, or library.
Write a letter to someone and tell them how they have had a positive impact on your life.
If you smoke – quit.
If you drink and drive – stop.
Turn off the electronics and take a kid out for ice cream and talk to them about their hopes and dreams.
Forgive someone who doesn’t deserve it.
Stop at all lemonade stands run by kids and brag about their product.
Make someone smile today if it is in your power to do so.

9. Kamikaze pilots (age 17-19) pose with a puppy a day before their suicide missions.

Photo shows Corporal Yukio Araki (age 17 years old) holding a puppy with four other young men (age 18 and 19 years old) of the 72nd Shinbu Corps. An Asahi Shimbun cameraman took this photo on the day before the departure of the 72nd Shinbu Corps from Bansei Air Base for their kamikaze mission in Okinawa.
Yukio Araki became the youngest kamikaze pilot during the Second World War when, at the age of seventeen, he took off from the Bansei Airfield, Kagoshima in a Tachikawa Ki-54 twin-engine training aircraft on 27 May 1945. It has been speculated that his plane was one of two that struck the destroyer USS Braine (DD-630), killing 66 of its crew; however, the ship did not sink. Araki had been home in April 1945, and left letters for his family, to be opened upon the news of his death. The letter to his parents noted: “Please find pleasure in your desire for my loyalty to the Emperor and devotion to parents. I have no regrets. I just go forward on my path”.
Ceremonies were carried out before kamikaze pilots departed on their final mission. The Kamikaze shared ceremonial cups of sake or water known as “mizu no sakazuki”. Many Army officer Kamikaze took their swords with them, while the Navy pilots (as a general rule) did not carry swords in their planes. The kamikaze, like all Japanese aviators flying over unfriendly territory, were issued (or purchased, if they were officers) a Nambu pistol with which to end their lives if they risked being captured. Like all Army and Navy servicemen, the Kamikaze would wear their senninbari, a “belt of a thousand stitches” given to them by their mothers. They also composed and read a death poem, a tradition stemming from the samurai, who did it before committing seppuku. Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations. The Kamikaze were escorted by other pilots whose function was to protect the Kamikaze to their destination and report on the results.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Interesting History Facts They Didn't Teach You In School</a>
1. “A bizarre incident in 1704 might have seen G.F. Handel's composing career cut tragically short after a set-to with fellow composer Johann Mattheson. For reasons apparently unknown, the two had a fierce quarrel in which Mattheson almost killed Handel with his sword, which fortunately struck a brass button on Handel's chest rather than the chest itself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87185302.jpg">

Had the metal button not saved Handel's life, his famous oratorio Messiah (with its "Hallelujah Chorus") would never have been composed.” - Back2Bach

2. “The odyssey of Helmut von Mücke during ww1. Dude got stranded with a boarding crew on an island in Indonesia, sailed across the Indian Ocean on a stolen Dutch boat, traveled through Arabia and turkey while trying to not get involved in the Arab revolt, and finally got home via Istanbul. Dude wrote a book about his adventures and became a pacifist because every one of his man he guided in this journey later died in the war.” - R3v1cu7

5. “Belgian king Albert the first. During World War One he actively took command of the Belgian military and at times was in the trenches with his men. As far as I’m aware he’s the only king to do that during the First World War. He’s a war hero. Sadly he’s overshadowed by his predecessor Leopold II (known for the atrocities in Congo) and his successor Leopold III (who caused a major political divide after the Second World War that is still a problem to this day).” - Petrus_Rock

6. “This is a short version of the story, but.. The "White House," presidential building of the USA, got its name following the war of 1812. America failed to cross the Niagara river and invade Canada. The Canadian forces then crossed over the river, pushed the Americans back, and kept pushing deeper and deeper, all the way to the presidential building. They set it on fire. Afterward, the building was repainted entirely white and thus became known as "The White House." - Castle_of_Aaaaaaargh

7. “This isn't talked about much because of how heartbreaking it is. That started WW2 when pearl harbor was bombed in Hawaii, on one of the vessels that were bombed and sunk to the ocean floor actually had people alive in it locked in an air-tight room. So for like two weeks, there were these 2-4 people trapped in the air-tight room. The military couldn't get them out because if they tried to open the room the pressure would kill the people inside instantly or something along those lines.

Their screams could be heard when they yelled for help, and people were stationed to listen for when they stopped so they knew when the people had... Yk passed.. it was such a mental toll on the people stationed there that people literally couldn't do it. Their friends are right there yet so far… After about two weeks, the screams stopped and they opened the room. They found the bodies and they had scratched tallies into the wall on how long they were there. It was hard to tell if they had died from lack of water, food or ran out of oxygen… They were cremated and their ashes lie with the boat. War sucks.” - UserNotFound44

8. “It's more a fun history fact. I've recently read about Joseph Menck, the last knight of Bohemia. He was a history buff from inter-war Czechoslovakia. He lived in a ruined castle near German borders, was teaching local children history, and lived to the medieval code of honor. In 1938 when Wehrmacht attacked his village, he took his armor on and mounted his horse.

Then he rode out and blocked the road. Nazis thought he was crazy and let him live. He didn't achieve any victory, but the man definitely had balls of steel. These are the stories that are largely forgotten but should be taught about. Single acts of bravery from people who decided to not give up. People like Mencik or the Tiananmen square man show us that even a single human can resist evil.” - Jirik333
