<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87227840.jpg">

2. Disney's Aladdin was originally supposed to be set in Baghdad, but John Musker and Ron Clements were forced to change it due to the outbreak of the Gulf War. So, they took letters and did a jumbled anagram and came up with Agrabah.

3. During the Gulf War, the U.S. dropped a 6,800 kg BLU-82 bomb to conduct psychological warfare against Iraqi troops. A British SAS unit that witnessed the explosion assumed the U.S. had used a nuclear weapon and radioed back to their headquarters, "Sir, the blokes have just nuked Kuwait!"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87227842.png">

4. The first human surrender to a robot occurred in the 1991 Gulf War. The US used UAVs (drone robots) to find artillery targets.

8. During the run-up to the Gulf War, Muhammad Ali traveled to Iraq and personally secured the release of 15 American hostages being detained by Saddam Hussein, despite the US Government and press condemning the mission and Ali as 'another egomaniacal celebrity out of his depth'.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87227850.jpg">

12. During the Gulf War when American forces were faced with extensive trenches of Iraqi soldiers they, "opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87227851.jpg">

13. In 1990, Nayirah al-Ṣabaḥ, daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador to the US, gave a false testimony which galvanized support for the first Persian Gulf War.
