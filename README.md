## <a href="#link1" id="link0">20 Eerie Things That Happened to People Working in Morgues</a>
1. You know in the movies where the pathologist or mortician or whoever sets their sandwich on the dead guy? Nobody would ever do that in real life, right? Of course not. It was a bowl of cereal. -ITeechYoKidsArt

2. I helped with an autopsy where a woman wasn't found for a few weeks and her cats started chewing on her. -riphitter

3. You have smelt nothing until you have smelt the farts of the dead. -TheGarp

4. Refrigeration mechanic here, our company took on a contract for a funeral home that did it all (storing, embalming, cremation etc) one of my first repairs was to replace a failed motor in their main body cooler. It’s definitely a strange feeling being the only living person in a ice box containing 25 dead bodies. -TomaszRS

5. My best friend growing up lived in the "upstairs" of his family owned funeral home. We used to play hide and go seek in the caskets until one day one of the "empty" caskets wasn't empty because they had just gotten a "delivery" from a different funeral home. -slytherinprolly

6. My wife is a mortician. she's had quite a lot of wacky experiences. this is more funny than creepy, but once she was trying to break up the rigor mortis in a decedent's hip by flexing the entire leg up. her grip slipped and the leg swung down, the heel cracking her right in the face, resulting in a black eye. -iamblankenstein
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035038/87313713/blackeye.jpg">

7. Maggots crawling out of orifices always got me. -bemi_san
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035111/87313725/maggots.jpg">

8. I had a friend in Boy Scouts whose dad got a job in a morgue washing the hair of dead people. On his first job by himself, he wheeled the body under the faucet and turned it on. Then he hears a shriek and, "THAT'S COLD!" He ran out of the basement like a bat out of hell. His boss was at the door laughing his ass off as his partner crawled out from under the gurney. -Broad-Blood-9386

9. Funeral Director here. About 15 years ago I had a lady whose husband passed from a terrible motorcycle accident. When she came in to make arrangements, she mentioned that she wanted his leather jacket back. Not terribly uncommon for people to want the personal effects back however in this case the jacket was ripped and torn and saturated with blood and had bone fragments embedded in it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035106/87313720/jacket.jpg">

Personal effects from the corners office are usually returned in a sealed bag. The second it was given to her, she took it out and put it on. It smelled terrible. I truly hope she is doing OK now. -sttgal
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035107/87313721/holdinghand.jpg">

10. The funeral home I worked for liked to embalm as soon as possible after death. I had embalmed a man that was dead for less than 30mins-an hour. He was still warm and rigor had not set in yet. I kinda just held his hand for a minute before I got started. -Abisnailyo
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035108/87313722/jewerlystolen.jpg">

11. One of the decedent's grandsons faked a breakdown over the casket. He stole all her jewelry. Didn't take long to figure out and a large brawl broke out. Jewelry was retrieved. Two weeks later grandson turns up needing to be processed and buried. Creepy as hell. -tossaway78701
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035109/87313723/limbs.jpg">

12. Sometimes a fresh corpse will get shaky limbs. -alien-eggs
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035110/87313724/lungs.jpg">

13. Sometimes when people have died, and we turn them over to clean and dress them, they still have air in their lungs and will make grunting noises when moved. Scared the crap out of me, the first time I experienced it. -Kvoller
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035112/87313726/nameatnight.jpg">

14. I had to go to the funeral late one night to get some things ready for my manager to go pick a body up as it was a friend of hers and she just wanted to show up and go. My wife came with me for the drive and I was in the basement while my wife waited up stairs.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035117/87313727/mouth.jpg">

The basement has two parts to it. One is newer and the older section (which we called the catacombs) is where we kept caskets, supplies, etc. I was getting the spare stretcher ready, making sure there’s gloves and other supplies with it when I heard my name called but it came from the catacombs. It was a deeper voice too that made my hair stand on end. I had just been in the catacombs too which made it creepier.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035122/87313728/pizza.jpg">

Wasn’t my wife and there was no one else there as we left before my manager came in. No idea what it was but it definitely freaked me out. -Crucifix1233

15. Worked at a mortuary for a few years. We have methods to keep the jaw shut for viewing, otherwise it would gap open due to the angle of the head and neck. During a viewing the device failed and this gentleman’s mouth literally popped open.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035125/87313730/pitchdark.jpg">

The lead embalmer was not on site so I did my best. Ushered the family out of the room and superglued his mouth shut, but he didn’t have teeth and supergluing just his lips did NOT work. It looked as if he was attempting to scream. I had to call in one of our other mortuaries in town and that embalmer used a giant needle and thread to sew his mouth shut from under his chin to his palate. -Maelja
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/01/035128/87313732/sludgeprank.jpg">

16. I delivered pizza to a crematorium. Dude set down his pizza on a cardboard coffin to get money and I couldn't stop looking at the box on the conveyer leading into the crematorium chamber.

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Irresistibly Strange Facts To Feed Your Appetite For Weirdness</a>
1. Hurricanes seldom produce any good results, but Matthew did one good thing at least.
When Hurricane Matthew used its destructive force to wreak havoc on land masses, it also had an unexpected side effect. It unearted dozens of Civil War cannonballs on Folly Island in South Carolina.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170602.jpg">

2. Can a dog be a mayor? Apparently they can if they're from Minnesota.
There also doesn't seem to be an age requirement given that a nine-year-old Great Pyrenees was elected mayor of the Minnesota town of Cormorant, not once, not twice, but three times. They must have some really bad human candidates in Minnesota.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170603.jpg">

3. Turtles may be slow but they can sure yap, even before they've hatched.
According to researchers at the University of Western Sydney, turtles are able to synchronize their maturation process and hatch at the same time simply by talking to each other. It's apparently a natural form of protection so that they all hatch at the same time before a predator gets them.

4. If you thought you couldn't swim through syrup as fast as you can swim through water, guess again.
Edward Cussler of the University of Minnesota filled a 25 meter pool with 300 kilos of guar gum, shampoo, and ice cream. Although it looked like snot, the 16 volunteers who swam across the icky pool only suffered a 4 percent reduction in their speed. Hardly enough to complain about.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170605.jpg">

5. Given this year's deeply controversial presidential election, it might surprise you to learn who the first Republican president of the U.S. was.
The Republicans didn't come to power from the very beginning. In fact, it wasn't until Abraham Lincoln, became the 16th president of the U.S. that Republicans finally had a voice.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170606.jpg">

6. This correctional facility was once an Olympic Athletes Village.
Back in 1980, Olympic athletes like U.S. Olympic hockey team captain, Michael Eruzione called this compound his temporary home. Who would have thought that it would have been converted into the Adirondack Correctional Facility seven months after the Olympic games ended that year?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170607.jpg">

7. Would you ever want to leave in a town called "Fail"? You might not have a choice if you live here.
If you thought you grew up in a boring town, be grateful you didn't grow up in this Portuguese town called "Fail" because that would have been an epic... well you know.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170608.jpg">

8. You might not be able to see UV rays but some insects can.
There are a lot of species, including bees, along with birds and reptiles that have the ability to see within the UV spectrum and scientists think that this is because UV has shorter wavelengths than conventional light.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170609.jpg">

9. Delhi and Mumbai don't have a monopoly on Indian Restaurants, but London sure does.
There are 15,000 Indian restaurants in the UK and it's one of the largest industries in the country. Not only does it earn $5 billion collectively but also provides 70,000 people with employment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170610.jpg">

10. Sexual maturity doesn't reach its peak for Female Greenland Sharks until they're way over a hundred.
But that's not a problem for the females of these species given that most of them have a life span of at least 4 centuries. So reaching their sexual maturity at 150 must be like 13 in human years.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170611.jpg">

11. Most popes lead a very humble life, despite living in the Vatican, but John Paul II's death was a whole lot pricier.
In fact, the beloved Pope's entire funeral event ended up accruing a cost of over 8 million dollars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170612.jpg">

12. Tugrul, a sports teacher, made a shocking scientific discovery purely by accident in 2014.
A two-headed dolphin washed up on the shores on the west coast of Turkey while he was out for a walk. Unfortunately, it was deceased but biologists determined that its condition was the result of something similar to conjoined human twins.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170613.jpg">

13. 17 percent of twins are left-handed compared to the 10 percent of siblings who aren't twins.
In general, there are more right-handed people than left handed people, unless you're a twin. But the percentages vary depending on whether the twins are identical, fraternal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170614.jpg">

14. Most kings are too busy, but the King of Jordan traveled through space in the 24th century.
Well, technically he didn't. Abdullah bin Al-Hussein was offered a role as an extra on Star Trek Voyager in the episode called "Investigations."

15. Want to know why stores like Walmart are tough on shoplifters? Here's why.
On average, it ends up costing Walmart up to $3 billion dollars a year due to shoplifters, and of course employees who have sticky fingers and love to "borrow" things without paying for them.

16. 603 Million women live in countries where human rights don't protect them from domestic violence.
While some parts of the world have given women their well-deserved respect politically, socially and economically, some countries in parts of the world like South Asia, Africa, and the Middle East have no laws against domestic violence, arranged marriages and female genitalia mutilation.

17. Even in death, Michael Jackson managed to acrue a large audience.
While Lady Di's funeral was viewed by 33.25 million, the beloved pop star's funeral was the second most watched by 31 million people.

18. Years before the Challenger disaster, astronauts left behind something on the moon to commemorate travelers who lost their lives.
During the Apollo 15 mission, the astronauts left a little something behind on the moon in 1971. It was a figure of a fallen astronaut to honor those pioneers who had traveled through space before and died.

19. Al Capone couldn't very well advertise what he did on a business card.
So anyone who he gave a card to was surprised to learn that he was a "furniture businessman." Guess mob boss would have been a little too obvious for Elliott Ness.

20. There's a reason why Warren Buffet is known as the "Oracle of Omaha."
At the tender age of 11, Buffet had already started buying stocks and now he's one of the richest business leaders in the whole wide world.

21. Seinfeld may have been recorded in front of a live studio audience, but the theme song was a little more complicated.
Since the opening monologue kept getting in the way, the studio couldn't just plug in the theme song in every episode. Instead they had to re-record it every single time for all 180 episodes across 9 seasons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85170622.jpg">

22. Bob Dylan's tour may not have been never ending but it sure felt that way.
The musician began touring in 1988, and continued to do nearly 100 shows per year over a period of 28 years. It's believed that his "Never Ending Tour" had over 2,700 shows worldwide.

23. In 2008, Cops in the UK did the unthinkable and gave a 7-year-old the right to bear arms.
The laws actually allow underage children to own a firearm there. In fact, a spokesperson from West Mercia Force assured the public that the application for the license was considered carefully and approved as long as the boy's dad, who is also certified to have firearms, supervises. Yikes!

24. Hitler's love for animals was well known, except for cats of course. So why did he give his dog cyanide?
Well apparently, while in a bunker, he feared being betrayed, drugged and turned over to the Russians. So he wanted to make sure that if that happened, the cyanide capsules would work. He fed one to Blondi, his German Shepherd, and then killed her pups too.

25. Octopus can be playful, curious, and smart, but they can also change their skin colors several times per hour.
According to studies, they've been known to change color as much as 177 times in 60 minutes, which is probably why the Greeks loved to create myths around them.

26. Tigers have a heftier appetite than you do.
They can eat up to 60 pounds of meat in one night. Can you imagine all the heartburn they must experience when they try to sleep?

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Innocent Man Who Survived 22 Years On Death Row Tells Of His Experience</a>
1. Nick Yarris was sentenced in 1981, for the rape and murder of Linda Mae Craig and served 22 years in solitary confinement before being released from death row in 2004.  Yarris was confined to his cell for 23 hours a day for 22 very long years, and read around 9,400 books as he educated himself about the law so he could prove his lack of guilt. "I was showing them an unbelievable brilliance beyond what they would expect," Yarris said. "When they imagine someone on death row, they think of some terrible loser guy, who isn't going to have anything to say. "They don't think it's going to be someone that would wow them, and I have."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85393539.jpg">

2. In 1981, at age 20, Yarris was arrested for the kidnap and murder of a police officer after being pulled over in a stolen car. To get off the charges, his drug-laden mind decided to tell officers that he knew who had murdered a woman, Linda Mae Craig, whose case he had seen covered in the papers. He gave them the name of a man he thought was dead, but after his lie was caught, Yarris was charged with the crimes himself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85393540.jpg">

3. In 1988, when DNA testing was first introduced, Yarris made his first attempt at clearing his name. However, he spent many more years inside jail awaiting the results of his DNA test after the sample he gave the lab broke. And in 2002, when Yarris was at the end of his ropes he finally begged the judge if he could die. But before doing so the judge asked if the DNA could be tested one last time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85393537.png">

4. And after 22 long years Yarris was found not-guilty of the crimes with which he was charged and so he was released, a free man once again.  Yarris received compensation upon his release, which he called 'pity money', and is now on his way to Hollywood to film a biopic about his life. Now that's the smile of a freeman!

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">14 Window Washers Reveal The Strangest Things They've Seen</a>
1. We were cleaning a fairly tall building 12 stories iirc adjacent to an equally tall government office building. This office building had several bedrooms on the top level, which we could see from the roof but certainly not from the ground. From where we were standing this bedroom was about ten meters away. As we're setting up a naked dude jumps onto his bed with an ipad and starts masturbating furiously. Facing us.

Not weird necessarily but certainly unpleasant
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493003.jpg">

2. Few years back at the age of 17 I took a full 3 day safety training and did this as a part time to get quick cash. This was in Chicago at the Holiday Inn.

Me and my partner(25-ish) at the time where almost done with our shift as it become close to dark. As we get to this one room, it was oddly brighter.... then usually rooms. When we reach it, we find a group of people in animal costumes rubbing and smacking each other. Me and my partner were like wtf? The room was full of glitter on the floors and had a bunch of rainbow type shit sprayed on the walls. We wanted to finish quick. As we started decending they caught us and gave us what looked like sharp looks, but we couldn't tell because of the wolf heads and animal heads and bodies they had on. We booked it and told the front desk what was up. After they checked it out they got back to us and told us they kicked them out and damages the room. So it was out of service last time I checked.

3. High rise window cleaner here. The most bizarre thing I saw had to be a taxidermy alligator with bird wings sprouting out of its back, chained to the ceiling. Also, a wooden penis in the window sill that I could only guess was an art piece of some sort.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493005.jpg">

4. I had descended down to about the 20th floor of a 35 story building. The blinds were closed... Mostly. I was doing post construction cleaning (scraping glue, calking, cement and other unpleasantness from the windows and frames) so I spent quite a bit more time on each window than when purely washing. I get to the bottom section of one of the larger windows to find this small opening in the blinds. Behind them is a rather shapely woman naked, with her back turned to me. I pull out my scraper to take some more stubborn bits off the window and end up making some noise which startles the lass. When she turns I can see her laptop facing us webcam on. There is a steady stream of chat flowing on the right hand side. It was then I knew I'd come across a cam girl. She came over to the window. I thought she'd be mad but instead she opened the blinds and played with herself. Just then, the suction cup I was using for stability against the building released causing me to nearly soil myself. Not bad for 2 weeks in to the job.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493006.png">

5. I work for my dad during the summer for his window washing company ( check my post history ) and one day I'm working in an office at like 8 pm at night ( we were doing interior cleaning) and as usual every one is mostly gone but some late workers. Well that night we just arrived on a new floor and as we turn the corner to start, my dad and I walk in on 2 guys full on making out. Definitely not expected but we all laughed it off. This was an admin building for a bank in Montreal btw
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493007.jpg">

6. Window cleaner based in Fort Worth and I once had someone open the window and offer me coffee while in mid-air. It was quite refreshing.

7. Not a window washer but building restoration. It took us about a week to finish a drop of fifteen floors so for a full week, as our lift went up every morning we were treated to a pretty damn attractive woman in her late forties standing stark naked in front of her sliding glass door, drinking a cup. She always smiled and waved and never seem the least bit embarrassed.

8. I played with an orange kitty through a window once. That was nice. I also kicked through someone's screen because the window was open. Surprisingly no naked people so far.

9. Noting too strange but a third floor pole dancing class (got to do two passes on their windows hehe). The other was a guy smoking a bong by the window, think me dropping in blew his mind a bit because he looked pretty shocked.

10. I worked on swing stages doing concrete finishing and I once saw a grown man jumping on his bed in his tighty whities. I wasn't even shocked. He just looked like he was having so much fun.

11. Not so much a window washer but window replacer. Woman (mid 20s daughter of the homeowner) walked into the room like she had 1000 times before, took her clothes off faster than I could say "excuse me mam, allow me to avert my gaze" but when I did get words out she screamed and ran out of the room. A little while later her mother came out and asked if that meant they'd get a discount.

12. Years ago I was washing windows on a Chicago condominium in the gold coast on a 40' long stage. We were instructed not to work past 5pm due to residents privacy. Fine, but it was 4:30pm, my partner and i wanted to squeeze in 1 more drop. But we'd have to work fast.

We approached the 23rd floor and what to my surprise did I see on the kitchen table!?! A young couple bare naked going at it. I recognised the female, she was the pool life guard! They were 5' away from me. It was surreal. I was shocked, I froze. She was on the bottom w/her legs in the air and she looked at me w/o any interruption and said nothing to her partner. (that turned me on!) Meanwhile, my window washing partner was done w/his half and was already moving to the next floor down. I was excited and did not want to move. The stage was slanting in an angle, everything was sliding away from me. I couldn't even talk.

My partner marched toward me wondering why I did not do anything and he witnessed the fiasco himself. And knocked on the window! The guy, who was nailing the female was standing above her turned around and w/o pulling out attempted to lower the blinds reaching out with one hand but only knocked them to the ground. Heck w/it and continued to pound her hot body on the kitchen table.

Incredible. (I love telling that story)

13. Someone was shitting on the bed.

14. I was at the gyno for my annual visit waiting for the doctor to come in. I'm sitting in the chair, feet in the stirrups facing the window when I start to see the ropes of them coming up to next floor. I have never been frozen in fear like that in my life haha. Luckily the receptionist ran in at the last second and closed the blinds before they totally came up. Phew!
