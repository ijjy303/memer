## <a href="#link6" id="link5">14 Window Washers Reveal The Strangest Things They've Seen</a>
1. We were cleaning a fairly tall building 12 stories iirc adjacent to an equally tall government office building. This office building had several bedrooms on the top level, which we could see from the roof but certainly not from the ground. From where we were standing this bedroom was about ten meters away. As we're setting up a naked dude jumps onto his bed with an ipad and starts masturbating furiously. Facing us.

Not weird necessarily but certainly unpleasant

2. Few years back at the age of 17 I took a full 3 day safety training and did this as a part time to get quick cash. This was in Chicago at the Holiday Inn.

Me and my partner(25-ish) at the time where almost done with our shift as it become close to dark. As we get to this one room, it was oddly brighter.... then usually rooms. When we reach it, we find a group of people in animal costumes rubbing and smacking each other. Me and my partner were like wtf? The room was full of glitter on the floors and had a bunch of rainbow type shit sprayed on the walls. We wanted to finish quick. As we started decending they caught us and gave us what looked like sharp looks, but we couldn't tell because of the wolf heads and animal heads and bodies they had on. We booked it and told the front desk what was up. After they checked it out they got back to us and told us they kicked them out and damages the room. So it was out of service last time I checked.

3. High rise window cleaner here. The most bizarre thing I saw had to be a taxidermy alligator with bird wings sprouting out of its back, chained to the ceiling. Also, a wooden penis in the window sill that I could only guess was an art piece of some sort.

4. I had descended down to about the 20th floor of a 35 story building. The blinds were closed... Mostly. I was doing post construction cleaning (scraping glue, calking, cement and other unpleasantness from the windows and frames) so I spent quite a bit more time on each window than when purely washing. I get to the bottom section of one of the larger windows to find this small opening in the blinds. Behind them is a rather shapely woman naked, with her back turned to me. I pull out my scraper to take some more stubborn bits off the window and end up making some noise which startles the lass. When she turns I can see her laptop facing us webcam on. There is a steady stream of chat flowing on the right hand side. It was then I knew I'd come across a cam girl. She came over to the window. I thought she'd be mad but instead she opened the blinds and played with herself. Just then, the suction cup I was using for stability against the building released causing me to nearly soil myself. Not bad for 2 weeks in to the job.

5. I work for my dad during the summer for his window washing company ( check my post history ) and one day I'm working in an office at like 8 pm at night ( we were doing interior cleaning) and as usual every one is mostly gone but some late workers. Well that night we just arrived on a new floor and as we turn the corner to start, my dad and I walk in on 2 guys full on making out. Definitely not expected but we all laughed it off. This was an admin building for a bank in Montreal btw

6. Window cleaner based in Fort Worth and I once had someone open the window and offer me coffee while in mid-air. It was quite refreshing.

7. Not a window washer but building restoration. It took us about a week to finish a drop of fifteen floors so for a full week, as our lift went up every morning we were treated to a pretty damn attractive woman in her late forties standing stark naked in front of her sliding glass door, drinking a cup. She always smiled and waved and never seem the least bit embarrassed.

8. I played with an orange kitty through a window once. That was nice. I also kicked through someone's screen because the window was open. Surprisingly no naked people so far.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493010.jpg">

9. Noting too strange but a third floor pole dancing class (got to do two passes on their windows hehe). The other was a guy smoking a bong by the window, think me dropping in blew his mind a bit because he looked pretty shocked.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493011.jpg">

10. I worked on swing stages doing concrete finishing and I once saw a grown man jumping on his bed in his tighty whities. I wasn't even shocked. He just looked like he was having so much fun.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85493012.jpg">

11. Not so much a window washer but window replacer. Woman (mid 20s daughter of the homeowner) walked into the room like she had 1000 times before, took her clothes off faster than I could say "excuse me mam, allow me to avert my gaze" but when I did get words out she screamed and ran out of the room. A little while later her mother came out and asked if that meant they'd get a discount.

12. Years ago I was washing windows on a Chicago condominium in the gold coast on a 40' long stage. We were instructed not to work past 5pm due to residents privacy. Fine, but it was 4:30pm, my partner and i wanted to squeeze in 1 more drop. But we'd have to work fast.

We approached the 23rd floor and what to my surprise did I see on the kitchen table!?! A young couple bare naked going at it. I recognised the female, she was the pool life guard! They were 5' away from me. It was surreal. I was shocked, I froze. She was on the bottom w/her legs in the air and she looked at me w/o any interruption and said nothing to her partner. (that turned me on!) Meanwhile, my window washing partner was done w/his half and was already moving to the next floor down. I was excited and did not want to move. The stage was slanting in an angle, everything was sliding away from me. I couldn't even talk.

My partner marched toward me wondering why I did not do anything and he witnessed the fiasco himself. And knocked on the window! The guy, who was nailing the female was standing above her turned around and w/o pulling out attempted to lower the blinds reaching out with one hand but only knocked them to the ground. Heck w/it and continued to pound her hot body on the kitchen table.

Incredible. (I love telling that story)

13. Someone was shitting on the bed.

14. I was at the gyno for my annual visit waiting for the doctor to come in. I'm sitting in the chair, feet in the stirrups facing the window when I start to see the ropes of them coming up to next floor. I have never been frozen in fear like that in my life haha. Luckily the receptionist ran in at the last second and closed the blinds before they totally came up. Phew!
