2. McDonald's is the largest distributor of toys.

3. McDonald's owned Chipotle.
Now a massive, popular brand among Millennials, Chipotle used to be owned by McDonald’s since they held 90% of their shares. However, in 2008 they decided to sell their shares in order to focus on their sole business. They’re probably regretting that now.

4. A man named Ronald MacDonald robbed a Wendy's.
In a bit of shocking irony, a man named Ronald MacDonald in Manchester has been charged with stealing from a safe at a Wendy’s. It’s so surreal, we’re not totally sure how to feel about it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352690.jpg">

5. McDonalds is never more than 115 miles away in contiguous America.
If someone wanted to never see a McDonald’s again, the chances of doing so are very slim. With thousands of locations all over the place, on almost every corner, McDonald’s is never more than 115 miles away. There’s no escape.

6. McDonald's salad is more fattening.
Those trying to watch their waistline by eating a salad instead of a burger might want to rethink the salad option at McDonald’s. In a bitter turn of events, the salad is even worse for you than their burgers. There’s no winning.

7. Largest McDonald's playplace
Popular in the 1990’s, McDonald’s play places have slowly gone the way of the dinosaur, but people can always depend on their largest play place in Orlando, Florida. Of course, it’s located by all the major tourist attractions.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352693.jpg">

8. No horses allowed in the drive-thru

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352694.jpg">

9. Queen Elizabeth owns a McDonald's.
Because of course, she does. The Queen purchased a McDonald’s very close to Buckingham Palace, probably to get a quick snack or to beef up her financial portfolio (pun intended).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352695.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352696.jpg">

11. McDonald's CEO makes waaaaay more money than an employee (obviosuly).
Ouch. In this painful example of income inequality, it would take a McDonald’s employee seven months to make what their CEO makes in an hour.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352697.jpg">

12. The "I'm lovin' it" jingle has a contentious history.

14. McDonald's told its employees to avoid fast food.
In another bit of irony, McDonald’s once had a website to advise employees on work and life. One of their wise pieces of advice was to not eat fast food. Perhaps we should all take them up on that advice?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352700.jpg">

15. McDonald's sold hot dogs before hamburgers.
When McDonald’s was still owned by the McDonald brothers, they sold hot dogs before hamburgers. Ray Kroc changed this later on.

16. The Golden Arches is a popular symbol.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352702.jpg">

17. McDonald's actually isn't the largest fast food chain.
While most might think McDonald’s is the largest fast food chain, they would be wrong. Subway holds that spot in the United States.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352703.jpg">

18. McDonald's has employed 1 in 8 people.

20. McDonald's Breakfast sandwiches have funky ingredients.
The egg in McDonald’s breakfast sandwiches was not cracked on the side of their counter and made on their grill. Other ingredients found in McDonald’s eggs include chemicals that are found in hand soaps, moisturizers, and shaving cream, among other things. I’m lovin’ it?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352706.jpg">

21. McDonald's daily customer traffic is immense.
One would imagine a food chain McDonald’s size would have lots of customers, and they’d be right. They have approximately 62 million daily customers, larger than the population of Great Britain.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352707.jpg">

22. McDonald's serves beer.
The United States loves their fountain drinks, and McDonald’s is happy to oblige them. In Germany, however, they like a different kind of beverage, beer. Yes, in Germany, customers are able to order a beer with their Big Mac.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352708.jpg">

23. McDonald's is a big producer of waste.
The fast food industry is a prime contributor to waste and garbage around the world, but McDonald’s leads the way as one of the bigger fast food chains. Though they have made steps to help encourage recycling and reducing waste, they have a long way to go.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352709.jpg">

24. McDonalds used to sell pizza.
Once upon a time in the 1980’s, McDonald’s experimented with selling pizza. It failed, of course, because cooking a pizza takes way longer than grilling a hamburger. Though, apparently, pizza is still available in Ohio and West Virginia. Road trip, anyone?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85352710.jpg">

25. McDonald's sauces contain propylene glycol.
There’s nothing better than dipping a hot chicken McNugget into barbecue sauce, right? Well, you might think twice before doing it again. Their sauces contain propylene glycol, a “less toxic” chemical found in anti-freeze. Of course, the FDA approves it in very small doses.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">22 People Who Saw Extraordinarily Rare Things</a>
1. Remember in pirates of the Caribbean, they talk about "the green flash at dusk." It's a real meteorological phenomenon. I saw it once while out to sea in the navy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315250.jpg">

2. I lived on a sailboat off of Mexico. One day this huge item floated under the water. It was longer than the 44' sailboat. Then it breathed and we could tell what it was. It was a mom and baby blue whale.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315246.jpg">

3. I saw a woman slip on a banana peel.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315247.jpg">

4. My friend and I have the same birthday. One day at work, we got on an elevator. There were three other guys on it. One says to the others “big day tomorrow.” 5 semi random guys on an elevator all had the same birthday. I think the odds are (1/365)^4 or 1:17.8B if the fact that it was the next day isn’t significant.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315248.jpg">

5. I was swimming in the Pacific when four dolphins swam up to me, danced in circles, and swam between my legs. When they got close again I noticed one of the four looked more like a baby orca, that was a bright indigo color with a very tall dorsal fin. It barely looked real! I pet them all and they swam off to play in the waves. It was the most magical moment of my life.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315249.jpg">

6. Ball of lightning, God that s**t is bizarre. I was 14 and I just saw it going down some train tracks. After it disappeared there was this loud boom and I'm not sure if it exploded or made contact with something.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315251.jpg">

7. I witnessed the effects of the coronal mass ejection in March 1989.

8. Jul 2011: I say to my wife the international space station is going over tonight, it's a clear sky, and we agree to pop out to the country where there is less light pollution and take the kids who were 12 and 8. We watch and it goes overhead... and then splits in two. I drive home thinking any disaster would be on the news, so I watch that. Turns out, the final shuttle mission had just been completed and we had watched shuttle Atlantis depart the ISS for the final time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315244.jpg">

9. I saw a wheel come loose off a van as it attempted a right hand turn. The wheel rolled through traffic into the open bay of a tire store across the street. One in a million odds.

10. I saw someone take off their cap and stamp on it like they do in cartoons

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315255.jpg">

12. Back in the 1980s, I was on a plane and saw the space shuttle being carried piggyback on another plane.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315245.jpg">

13. In 1974 I was living in Delray Beach and I was hanging out at the back door looking out talking to my sister who lived in Illinois. All of the sudden there was a huge ball of fire in the sky and I told her I thought an airplane head just exploded over the West Palm Beach airport. Later watching the news I learned that it was a meteor that had fallen into Lake Okeechobee.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315256.jpg">

14. My grandfather took me to the hockey game where Buffalo Sabres goalie Clint Malarchuk had his carotid artery cut and his jugular vein partially sliced by an errant hockey skate. He was bleeding out on the ice in front of our eyes. The Sabres trainer, who had been a US Army combat medic in Vietnam, knew to reach in the wound and pinch off the artery to save his life.

15. Fire rainbows are pretty rare, mostly just drenching a corner of a cloud in colors.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315258.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315261.jpg">

19. Huge section of cliff falling into the Gallatin River. Easily the size of a football field came down all at once.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315262.jpg">

20. Northern lights near my house. It usually doesn't happen that far south.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315263.jpg">

21. Flying to Reno back in the 90's. There was this awesome comet that turned out to have a bigger display than people predicted. It was awesome.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87315264.jpg">
