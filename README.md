## <a href="#link3" id="link2">Guns That Were Game Changers</a>
1. Benelli Black Eagle
Back in 1991, little-known gun company Benelli introduced an autoloading shotgun with their inertia-driven system; the world of autoloading shotguns hasn’t been the same since.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264083.jpg">

2. Knight MK-85 
In 1985, sporting goods store owner and amateur gunsmith Tony Knight built a muzzleloader with the nipple directly behind the powder charge, at the rear of the barrel, rather than to the side as with more traditional muzzleloaders. In addition to making ignition far more reliable, Knight’s design is also credited with “sparking” (pun intended) the modern muzzleloading revolution.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264084.jpg">

3. Ruger Number One
Bill Ruger was infamous for building not what customers wanted to buy but what he wanted to build. The falling-block actioned No. 1 single-handedly resurrected American interest in the single shot rifle.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264085.jpg">

4. Ruger 10/22
first introduced in 1964, the Ruger 10/22 is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle rimfire cartridge and is the standard by which all other .22 rifles are judged.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264086.jpg">

5. M-16 
Based on the AR-10 designed by Eugene Stoner, the M-16 and its variants started the “modern sporting rifle” craze, and it remains in use by militaries all over the world. It was officially adopted by the U.S. military in 1969 (although it was in use as early as 1963), and the AR platform remains very popular among civilian shooters today.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264087.jpg">

6. Remington 700 
The Remington 700, designed from the ground up to be a mass produced weapon, is one of the most popular bolt action rifles available today. It enjoys great popularity with civilian as well as military and police shooters worldwide and is one of the most accurate out-of-the-box rifles ever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264088.jpg">

7. Mossberg 500 
The Mossberg 500, first introduced in 1961, is currently the number one selling shotgun in America and is second in total production, behind the Remington 870. Its low cost, rugged reliability and literally hundreds of variations make it popular with military/law enforcement personal, hunters, and gun enthusiasts all over the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264089.jpg">

8. Marlin Model 60 
First introduced in 1960 as an inexpensive recreational rifle, Marlin claims that it is the most successful of its type in the world with over 11,000,000 produced. What we do know for certain is that made recreational shooting accessible to millions.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264090.jpg">

9. M-14 
The M-14 began replacing the M1 Garand as early as 1959, and stands as America’s last true “battle rifle” (standard issue rifle firing a full-power rifle cartridge). It remains a well-loved weapon that still sees limited use today
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264091.jpg">

10. AK-47 
First introduced into active service in 1948, the AK-47 is the most widely produced firearm… ever. Designed by Mikhail Kalashnikov, it remains in widespread use all over the world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264092.jpg">

11. MG-42
First adopted by the German Army as a replacement for the fragile and expensive MG-34 (itself the first modern general purpose machine gun), the MG-42 and the terrifying 1,200-1,500 rounds per minute were so feared that the U.S. Army created training films to help soldiers handle the psychological trauma of facing one in battle. Variants of “Hitler’s Buzzsaw” remain in service today.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264093.jpg">

12. Winchester Model 70 
Often called “The Rifleman’s Rifle,” Winchester Model 70s made before 1964 remain some of the most highly sought after bolt action rifles in existence.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264094.jpg">

13. M1 Garand
The first standard issue semi-automatic service rifle in the world, General George S. Patton called the M1 “The greatest battle implement ever devised.” What else is there to say?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2447893/85264095.jpg">

14. Browning M2 
The Browning M2 machine gun, designed by John Browning to fire the formidable .50BMG cartridge, is simply the most prolific machine gun in history. Production began in 1933, and the “Ma Duce” remains in widespread usage today.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">10 Odd Predictions That Came True</a>
1. Vladimir Odoevsky, who came out with a novel called “Year 4338” in 1835, described a world in which instant messaging, blogging, and even status updates were a very popular form of communication. Sounds a lot like social media, no?

2. In 1987, Apple introduced the world to a video called “Knowledge Navigator.” It was about the future of computing and boy did they get it right. The video shows us touchscreen handheld devices, video calls, and a digital knowledge assistant, much like Siri does today. Interestingly enough, the date specified in the video is September 16th, 2011. That date is just 18 days away from when all of those features became available on the phone/tablet format.

3. In 1953 an author by the name of Ray Bradbury released a novel called “Fahrenheit 451.” In this novel we are introduced to a world in which books are outlawed and burned. So, for people to learn, they are fed information through tiny seashells that are placed in their ears and fed radio signals. Nowadays with wireless headphones, that’s pretty much exactly what we have.

4. In 1903 Edward Morgan Forrester released a novel called “The Machine Stops” which depicts a world in which people only communicate with each other using digital screens. He even goes as far as describing the fact that ideas and general knowledge are shared with everyone through a digital system that links everyone together. He pretty much predicted the internet before radio was even a mass medium.

5. John Brunner’s 1968 novel “Stand On Zanzibar” made a bold prediction that in the year 2010, America would have an African American president named “Obomi.”

6. Gen. Billy Mitchell had plenty of highly successful flight programs against the Germans during WWI. After these successes, he went on record with an incredibly bold prediction about a future aerial attack. He stated: “Attack will be launched as follows: Bombardment, attack to be made on Ford Island (in Pearl Harbor) at 7:30 AM.”

7. Back in 1989, Frank Zappa’s “The Real Frank Zappa Book” describes in great detail a method in which people can buy and sell music digitally. He even goes as far as saying that this shift in music purchasing won’t happen for at least another decade. Well, look where we’re at now!

8. A French Marshal by the name of Ferdinand Foch was either a cynic, a psychic, or a smart, smart man, because at the end of World War One, he stated “This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.” Astonishingly enough, World War Two started 20 years and 28 days later.

9. In 1993, a senior high school student by the name of Michael Lee had his yearbook quote say the following: “Chicago Cubs. 2016 World Champions. You heard it here first.” As we all know by now, the Cubs actually pulled it off this year. While there has been speculations that this year book quote was shopped, so far nobody has been able to prove it to be a fake. To this day there have been dozens of copies of the year book dug up by people who attended the same school, and all of them have the now infamous Cubs quote.

10. Cowboy Bepop, a popular anime in the late 90’s, aired a few episodes that featured a spacecraft that went by the name Columbia. The spacecraft was sent on a rescue mission that nearly failed thanks to its heat resistant tiles peeling off during the mission. The freaky part is that in 2003, the space shuttle Columbia went up in flames after its heat resistant tiles peeled off during take off.
