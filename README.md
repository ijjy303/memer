## <a href="#link2" id="link1">8 Crazy Experiments From Real Life Mad Scientists</a>
1. Britches :
Britches was a monkey who was torn from his mother and forced into animal testing at the University of California. He was assigned to a project that would test a prototype sonar device for blind people. The only problem is that Britches wasn't blind. The scientists sewed his eyes shut. He was eventually freed by the Animal Liberation Front during a raid in 1985.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126404.jpg">

2. Project MKUltra :
In the 1950s, the CIA's resident scientists began experimenting with mind control, using LSD, electroshock therapy, and the repetition of sound. Most of their findings were destroyed during the Watergate scandal, but there is evidence that the government dosed unsuspecting citizens with drugs to observe them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126405.jpg">

3. Skin Hardening : 
In an effort to make skin tougher for soldiers, Albert Kligman did experiments by using inmates as test subjects. Kligman would inject them with dangerous chemicals, but all his unfortunate test subjects got out of the deal were blisters, burns, and permanent scars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126406.jpg">

4. The Stanford Prison Experiment :
Subjects were organized into two groups. Some were the "guards" and the others were the "prisoners." Even though they were assigned these roles arbitrarily, the "guards" quickly started displaying sadistic behavior, forcing "prisoners" to strip naked and sleep on the hard concrete. One "prisoner" was dehumanized so much that he had a mental breakdown and was forced to exit the experiment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126407.jpg">

5. The Milgram Obedience Experiment :
Participants in this experiment were told by the experimenter to press a button that would shock another person in the other room. The person being shocked was actually just an actor pretending, but the participant didn't know that. All they were told was that experiment required them to continue shocking this person, upping the voltage until they were motionless. The study found that 65 percent of people would continue shocking the person even after they were screaming in pain. Shocking, right?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126408.jpg">

6. Harlow's Experiments In Isolation :
Rhesus monkeys were torn from their mothers as infants and forced into Harlow's "pit of despair" cage, with only a water bottle to keep them company. The point of the project was to study the effects of isolation on child development and subsequent depression. Not surprisingly, the baby monkeys became depressed. They also developed physical problems like poor digestion. Some even committed suicide by refusing food and water
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126409.jpg">

7. Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment :
The US Public Health Service purposefully injected black male sharecroppers with syphilis in order to study its effects. The effects, of course, were that they would get horrible skin disfigurations and eventually die. It seems the government neglected to treat them after infecting them with the STD. By the way, this went on between 1932 and 1970. That's 40 years! It spanned multiple presidencies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1322718/85126410.jpg">

8. Criminal Testicle Transplants :
Leo Stanley, head physician of the San Quentin prison in 1913, believed that males who committed crimes had less testosterone than other men, so he would test his theory by giving inmates new testicles. Because of the shortage of human scrotums, sometimes inmates would be fixed with animal balls instead.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">What You Could Buy With The Amount Spent On The 2016 Election</a>
1. 1. A Round Trip To The Moon - A group called Golden Spike is setting in place citizen visits to the moon, and you can go for only $750 million! For 1.5 billion you can actually walk on the moon, but that would be above your campaign funds.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068285.jpg">

2. 2. You Could Finance The Rest Of The Star Wars Movies - For $800 million you can either continue the greatness that George Lucas started or totally destroy it. Think about it, all the characters could simply get together and have a nice My Dinner With Andre type supper for two hours on your watch.

3. 3. You Could Stay At The Most Expensive Hotel In the World For 50 Years - The Royal Penthouse Suite at Geneva’s Hotel President Wilson is the epitome of luxury, and it could be your apartment for 50 years. With a 103" Bang & Olufsen flat screen TV, twelve bedroom and bathrooms, jacuzzi, billiard room and a terrace around the outside of the apartment with a view of the beautiful Alps, this might be the way to go. If you just want to stay now, it's only $83,200 USD a night.

4. 4. 1962 Ferrari 250 GT0 - The most expensive car in the world has a price tag of $35 million. You could by 40 of them. Just crash one at an auto show to make a bunch of old men cry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068288.jpg">

5. 5. The Chicago Cubs - This loved, down on its luck team could be all yours for the small price of $1 billion dollars. You could be the person to re-invent the oldest sports team in North America! And think, you'll still have extra money to take strippers and booze to your suite to watch the game!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068289.jpg">

6. 6. Restore the Gulf of Mexico - You could do something for humanity, like restoring the Gulf of Mexico which has the working price tag of $1 billion. After the Deep Horizon oil spill, BP gave $1 billion to states to help the cleanup effort, however, experts say the cleanup is far from over. Just use your money to help millions of people you jerk!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068290.jpg">

7. 7. The Hannah Montana Franchise - For $1 billion you could own all the rights and merchandising to one of the biggest teen pop franchises in history. However, now that it's over you'll probably only make money from Hannah Montana hairbrushes or some shit they sell at K-Mart. On second thought, just buy a ship with a huge hole in it, at least you can watch it sink like Miley's career.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068291.jpg">

8. 8. You Could Build 10,000 Schools For Unfortunate Children - Yep that's right! For the amount of money, the candidates are using to scream at each other and basically lie to all of us, they could be helping kids! With the foundation Pencils of Promise, you could fund the building of 10,000 schools that would help kids around the world for only $250 million. You would still have so much money and you know how much ass you would get for doing this?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068292.jpg">

9. 9. Rangyai Island - This beautiful private island could be all yours for the low price of $160 million. With close proximity to Thailand, you can easily get fresh food cooked by your own private chefs and a few guest to the island if you know what I mean . . .
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85068293.jpg">

10. 10. Do Whatever You F*cking Want - When it comes down to it, $1 billion dollars converts to $2,739,726 dollars a day. If you just sit in your house and jerk off and play Playstation, that means you save $2,739,726 dollars a day, that's $31.07 every second you sit on your ass. Just enjoy how much money you spend and whatever you do, don't think about how all this money is being used to promote two turds to run our country.
