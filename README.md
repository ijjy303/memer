## <a href="#link1" id="link0">20 Dark Secrets People Are More Comfortable Telling Strangers Online Than Their Family</a>
1. My grandma was in a car accident and broke her ankle so she stayed at my house and we took care of her while she recovered. I was entering puberty at the time and discovered that you could order porn on cable and was like a madman ordering porn.

The bill that month came out to $500 my mom thought it was my grandma because her novelas were on like channel 50-60 and the porn was 500-600 lmfaoooo. I’ve literally never told anyone to this day. -pinchefresona

2. My uncle owned an old Camaro that collected dust in his garage. When I was around 10 my family and I were in town visiting and I wrote the word “fuck” in the dust on the hood of the car. I used my thumb so that the letters were fatter than my normal index finger. A few hours later my aunt/uncle asked us who did it and I “proved” it wasn’t me by showing how the person who did it had bigger fingers than me. Taking that shit to my grave! -CLToris

3. That I didn't graduate from college. I failed one course my senior year, 2nd semester. The ceremony was already set up so they let everyone walk. I had no diploma in my award...nobody knows to this day and it's been 17 years. Failed one course, 3 credits. Was ashamed so I never went back for those 3 credits. So everyone believes I graduated. -TheLargeYard

4. I owe the bank $100k. -markoshenov

5. It's not my secret, but my mom's. And I'm not hiding it from everyone, just the person who it potentially matters to the most. When my mom was in high school in the 60s, she had a long-term serious boyfriend named Jimmy. They were each other's first, they were together for years, and were planning on getting married. He went away to college, my mom stayed behind, but they were still together. You know what happened next. He cheated and got the new girl pregnant. He comes home to break the news to my mom. Abortion was not legal at the time. He basically says that he wants to be with my mom, but he has no choice but to marry this other girl. My mom was devastated.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112129/87319152/callme.jpg">

Here's the secret: my mom was also pregnant by him, but hadn't told him yet. She decided she wasn't ever going to tell him. Jimmy went on to marry the other girl and never knew my mom was also pregnant. She told me that she later threw herself down a flight of stairs to cause a miscarriage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112142/87319156/churchpoop.jpg">

My mom actually reconnected with Jimmy during the early days of Facebook. She didn't have an account, but asked me to look for him using mine. He was still married to the same person. My mom was married to my dad. They wrote to each other for a while (using my account! ugh!) Signed their messages saying "I Love You."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112144/87319157/elevator.jpg">

My mom passed away a number of years ago. I think about this knowledge I have that Jimmy doesn't. This major life event thing that he doesn't even know happened. That could have changed the trajectory of many lives. I'm certainly not going to tell him. It's not my secret to tell. -kbivs

6. 'Call me maybe' is my morning alarm. -chilloutjustin777
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112150/87319159/korea.jpg">

7. I had an IBS attack once and had to violently shit in a church grounds behind someone’s car. Used underwear to wipe too and left that there. Not proud. -gotanycrisps
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112151/87319160/ghost.jpg">

8. I sometimes wonder if a bunch of people in an elevator are gonna stab me all at once. -DairyKing28
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112156/87319161/mush.jpg">

9. I would be perfectly ok with never talking to any of my immediate family again. -Dazzling-Toe-4955

10. My grandpa was stationed in Okinawa, Japan during the Korean war, while in the Marines. He hooked up with a woman there, and she got pregnant. So, I have a Japanese aunt and a few cousins, in Japan, whom I’ve never met before. -Cardinal270

11. Funny, light hearted story from my childhood. My little brother was in the shower, I could hear him singing. I put a coat on backwards, and a stocking cap pulled over my face, and waited outside the bathroom door. He opened the door (still singing, and dancing kinda), and I did the Frankenstein thing. Arms out, moaning “uhhhh”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112215/87319167/pornsite.jpg">

He screamed and fell backwards knocking the toilet completely over. Water went everywhere, the top of the toilet tank broke, shower curtain ripped down, and him laying on the floor in the middle of all this. I ran back down the hall; coat and hat off, and sauntered back casually. By then my mother and father and our sisters were there, and everyone is like, you know, what the hell. I’ve heard him tell this story as proof of the existence of ghosts. To this day (little feller is now a 52 year old bank manager with two kids)he believes in ghosts. I don’t feel a bit bad. -Jimmysweetspot
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112208/87319164/ones.jpg">

12. My wife is handicapped and I lied to her that I find it hard to clean/cut up mushrooms. She has self esteem issues because I can do things much easily than her. So I lied, and now she feels better. -bukake_attack
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112211/87319165/pest.jpg">

13. One of my closest co-workers, who is an integral part to our very large corporation killed a man in his late teens and threw the body in a lake. He only got off on a technicality. I work remotely so I don’t build a lot of personal relationships with people I work with regularly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112212/87319166/parenting.jpg">

I googled his full name. It freaked me out at first. But I’ve kinda gotten over it. I wonder if anyone else knows. It happened 40+ years ago. He will retire soon and then I might ask another co-worker about it. I just don’t want to stir the pot. -adamsfan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/13/112219/87319168/plans.jpg">

14. My wife and I aren't officially married. No one knows. We had a ceremony and everything, reception... the whole nine yards. We just never did the official paperwork.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">20 Common Sayings That are Completely False</a>
1. "‘What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’ Not necessarily. There are a lot of things that won’t kill you, but they’ll probably mess you up a lot and make you feel very weak."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231602.jpg">

2. "Good things come to those who wait."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231601.jpg">

3. "Out of sight, out of mind." Ever lost track of a spider?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231600.jpg">

4. "Absence makes the heart grow fonder.” BUT THEN ALSO, “out of sight, out of mind.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231603.jpg">

5. "Opposites attract."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231604.jpg">

6. "Time heals all wounds."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231606.jpg">

7. “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life.” This is like 98% BS. Generally, turning your hobbies or passions into a job just makes you hate things you once loved. Being forced  to do anything makes it significantly less fun. I absolutely despise when someone tells me to do something I wanted to anyway.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231609.jpg">

8. "Money is the root of all evil. The LOVE of money is the root of all evil."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231607.jpg">

9. "The early bird gets the worm." No, the early bird gets stuck waiting in line with everyone else who decided to be the early bird, as well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231608.jpg">

10. “Money doesn’t buy happiness.” Yes. Yes it does.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231610.jpg">

11. "If a bird poops on your head it's good luck." Sure Dan, tell that to the 3 birds last week that took aiming sessions at my head!

12. "Lightning never strikes the same place twice."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231605.jpg">

13. "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." Clearly invented by someone who had never heard of emotional trauma. Words don't have to be insults to break someone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231612.jpg">

14. "What goes around comes around." BS. I've seen people be jerks my entire life and they never got what should have come around to them."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231598.jpg">

15. "The customer is always right. They miss a part that says 'in terms of taste.' Basically it means what's trending. If anyone has worked in customer service you will know that the customer is almost always wrong.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231613.jpg">

16. "When I was in my 20s, my weight used to be 400 pounds. When I reached 180 a few years ago, an absurd number of doors started to open. Everything was suddenly easy for me; people were suddenly nicer to me, and I had no trouble finding work. Looks are important."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231599.jpg">

17. "He who smelt it dealt it."

18. "Cheaters never win."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231597.jpg">

19. "Rules are meant to be broken." They were made for literally the opposite.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87231614.jpg">

20. "You can be whatever you want to be. Sorry to break it to you kid, but reality don't work that way."

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">Mystery Bag Leads Man To Discover Some Else Living In His Apartment</a>
1. So, I just got a new job back in October, working Tech Support on the graveyard shift. I work from 1am - 12pm Friday through Monday's. Needless to say, adjusting my sleep schedule has been quite the task, but I have managed. On the days that I don't work, I still follow my work schedule, waking up at midnight, and staying up until at least 2pm before falling asleep as to keep my sleep schedule in line with my work schedule. I bought blackout curtains to help with this, as trying to sleep with the sun shining is not easy for me, I usually require complete darkness. I live alone, I started noticing weird things happening around my apartment when I would get home from work, or after waking up on my days off. Just little things at first, lights being on, that I swear I turned off, doors being left open or closed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85221104.jpg">

2. He describes the layout of his apartment, which is important to understand just how creepy the story is. Just so everyone can get a bit of understanding about my apartment: I live on the 2nd floor, and my building is right behind the leasing office. The entrance to my apartment requires you to enter the building first then there is a hallway with 2 apartments on either side, then you can enter the apartment. Each apartment has two deadbolts. One that you can unlock from the outside, and another that requires you to unlock from the inside. There is also a balcony, which faces east, complete with a large, sliding glass door and screen. I use it quite frequently, as I had potted plants out there, but have brought them inside due to the cold weather. My apartment is the one closest to the camera, I intentionally left out the number, for obvious reasons.

3. It turns out the uploader's credit card was stolen. This is where it gets creepy.    Now that they're not here, it had gotten harder to pass off these weird occurrences as my cats. Doors are still being left open and closed, and food has been disappearing from my fridge. At first I passed this off as just me being my usual self and just not remembering that I ate something when I was half asleep or bored. Recently, my boss gave me permission to work from home, as this shift is brand new, as the company is moving to 24/7 support, and the building owner refuses to heat my floor for my shift for only two people. So, I've been doing that for the past couple weeks and last week, I noticed, the metal rod, that acts as a secondary lock on the balcony door, wasn't engaged, so I put it back. I didn't think much of it at the time, as my computer faces my balcony door(I like to people watch and watch the sunrise, sue me) and I sometimes fidget with it with my feet while playing video games. On the 11th of December, my Credit card information was stolen and my account was charged +$3000. I was in the office that day, as a favor to my coworker, who was really creeped out being in the office alone in the middle of the night. The charge was made at 11:40am, just a few moments before I gotten off work, and I had the card on me still. (This is relevant, I promise) I was restless and didn't sleep well. I wake up at midnight, per usual, on Monday morning, and get my set up ready to take calls. Now, almost no calls come in on the weekends, so I'm usually screwing around on Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix.

4. And this is when the creepiness hits insane lengths.    Around 3:00am I was catching up on The 100 when someone unlocked my fucking door! I don't mean, picked the lock, I mean used a key. Thank god the secondary deadbolt was engaged but the person jiggled the door to try and get it to open. I ran and grabbed my gun looked out the peephole but saw nothing. I opened the door, with the intent to shoot someone, but the person was already gone. Before you ask, yes I called the cops, no they didn't find anything. There are no cameras in the hallways of the building, or outside them for that matter, and they told me that there wasn't enough evidence for them to do anything about it, and left. I didn't sleep at all the next night, and decided to stay home, on my days off, to try and catch the person, if they tried to come back. I also asked the leasing office if they handed out any extra keys to my apartment and they said "no." and informed them that I changed the locks on my door. You remember the picture from before? Showing my apartment door? Well the white door, just on the other side of the fire extinguisher, is my storage closet, opened with the same key for the deadbolt. I keep my Christmas tree/Decorations in there and decided it was time to set it up. As i'm pulling out the tree this evening, its only a 5ft tall fake tree that has all the lights attached to it already, I notice a bag, back behind it. A small, black duffel bag, in it, I found a change of clothes, sunglasses, shoes, toiletries and a notebook. What was in the notebook horrified me.
The notebook was packed with notes about the poster. What he found was so chilling he had to call the cops.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85221107.jpg">

5. There were notes about me. What hours/days I worked, notes about my cats, and updated notes that they were no longer there and the date, my fucking credit card number! As I went further and further back in the notes, I found two words, circled multiple times "Balcony Door." Which I assume is how the person entered my apartment for the first time. This creep had been living in my apartment while I've been at work for the past month and I didn't even know it! The worst part is, that I was in my apartment at the same time as this guy, at some point, and didn't even know it. That's the only way he would have gotten my credit card number, and my house key to make a copy somewhere!There are more notes, but I didn't take photo's of them before the police arrived. I was practically in shock and when I saw these notes, I completely shut down. There were notes about when I would leave on my days off, what I brought back, from where (probably based on shopping bags) How long I was gone...this guy stalked me for at least two months... They have found the person responsible for using my Credit Card info, and they're attempting to find her! They're hoping that they will be able to get some information on the guy who gave her my information, as the pants in the photo are in Men's 34/34.

6. For clarification: I did call the cops, they have the bag and everything inside. The only thing is, the guy hasn't come back for the bag, and the thing about fingerprints is that it can take months to a year to get an analysis back if its not "high priority" and to them, they have homicides to deal with, so Home Invasion is kind of bottom of the ladder. They pulled the security footage from the leasing office, but nothing was found. They are going to try to get CDOT to pull the footage from the Light Rail Station down the road to see if they find anything.

The thief was basically living in this dude's apartment and assumed control of his life while the guy was asleep, all while stealing his identity.
