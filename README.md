## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Man Finds Hidden Safe In His Grandparents' House</a>
1. When Redditor evilenglish's grandparents died, he was devastated. He loved spending time with them, and one of his most cherished memories was reading "Treasure Island" with his grandpa, which inspired dreams of finding his own buried treasure.

Their farmhouse in Tennessee was given to him after they passed, and when he went there one day to go through all of their belongings and clean it out, his fantasy of discovering hidden treasure came true.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166122.png">

2. When he opened their closet door, he was greeted with an unpleasant sight. The carpet was dirty and disgusting, so he decided to tear it up and throw it away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166123.png">

3. That's when he came across this strange slab and realized it was actually a safe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166124.png">

4. After pulling off the metal cap, he found a combination lock. He was really excited to unlock it and see what was inside, but he couldn't figure out the code.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166125.png">

5. He decided it was worth it to hire a locksmith, who had trouble opening it himself because of the limited amount of space he had to work with.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166126.png">

6. But after a lot of effort, the locksmith was able to remove the lock.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166127.png">

7. Then it was finally time to open that bad boy up!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166128.png">

8. At first, he saw what looked like a pile of wet bricks. He remembered that there had been a pipe leak in his grandparents' house a few years ago, and concluded that some water had gotten into the safe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166129.png">

9. The bricks turned out to be a bunch of vintage coin books.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166130.png">

10. The moisture had damaged their covers, but the coins inside were still in pretty good condition.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166131.png">

11. There were so many items packed inside the safe. This is only a third of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166132.png">

12. His grandma was an avid coin collector, so there were plenty of them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166133.png">

13. Some, like this silver dollar, were in mint condition because of their protective cases.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166134.png">

14. Others were only wrapped in plastic or paper, but they seemed to be fine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166135.png">

15. Unfortunately, the stacks of dollar bills he found weren't as well preserved.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166136.png">

16. Among the piles of money, there were also a few of his grandpa's antique guns and wristwatches.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166137.png">

17. He even came across a few bars of silver.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166138.png">

18. But the best part of his experience was probably discovering that this old toolbox was actually a treasure chest.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166139.png">

19. When he opened it, he was delighted to see that it was chock-full of jewelry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85166140.png">

20. What an awesome farewell gift to their grandson!

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">30 of the Tiniest Things People Got Offended Over</a>
1. Had someone get offended by me calling my brother "bro". They insisted that I was racist and that white people can't be related to Mexicans.

Like seriously lady. That's not how genetics work. We are 100% related and are a mix of white and Native American. Its not that unheard of for one biological sibling to come out lighter or darker than the other.

And even if we weren't related... Seriously? I'm racist for calling someone close to me my bro despite being different skin tones? Seriously?

Thank you for coming to my rant session. Have a good day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319570.jpg">

2. I once listened to my boss try to lecture the Fire Marshall because he was talking about something being flame retardant (her reasoning was you should just call it fireproof because retardant was an awful word.). It was one of those times where I really should have tried to stop her but instead I just stood off to the side probably making a surprised pikachu face.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319593.jpg">

3. I am a disabled person. My life sucks because of my disability and no longer being able to do the things I used to love makes me quite depressed sometimes. Some a*****e tried to lecture me about how I was ableist for wishing there was a cure for my disability. F**k me for not enjoying being in constant pain and possibly ending up in a wheelchair in the future I guess.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319571.jpg">

4. People get very offended that I don't like being touched.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319572.jpg">

5. This guy at a Halloween party I was at was dressed in a giant bacon costume.

Some girl was *yelling* at him for being so offensive toward Jews and Muslims (she was neither Jewish nor Muslim). One of the Muslim guys at the party asked her what the f**k she was talking about but she didn't back down lol

I have no idea why people feel they need to go out of their way to be (inaccurately) offended on behalf of other cultures/religions
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319573.jpg">

6. One time someone got offended when I put on my seatbelt, thought I was commenting on her ability to drive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319574.jpg">

7. At my wedding we marked the vegetarian items as vegetarian. This made the one vegetarian at my wedding (sister in law who hates me) fly into a catatonic rage because we are singling out the vegetarian food as vegetarian and not treating it as normal food. Then how the f**k are they supposed to know its vegetarian?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319575.jpg">

8. Sporks.

I once heard someone say, *"The spork is 'the devil's utensil' because it is the amalgamation of the masculine fork and the feminine spoon and is trying to blur gender lines in society."*
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319576.jpg">

9. A sandwich. I kid you not. My Ex husband was given a sandwich by our then 13yr old daughter and because she cut the sandwich he went off on a massive strop about how his sandwiches should never be cut etc. The poor kids face, she was crushed. It still winds me up no end every time I think about it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319577.jpg">

10. _Happy holidays_ successfully triggered an entire demographic. I'm still amazed by it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319578.jpg">

11. I told my my sister in a PM that it’s “1st” not “1rst” after she posted something on Facebook with the spelling error. She flipped out saying how I’m a “bully” and I need to “appreciate that her spelling is more unique”.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319579.jpg">

12. Using a walking stick. I was in a car accident a few years ago and it f****d my leg up. Since then i've been using a walking stick. I was walking to shop (pre-pandemic) and an old bloke gave me the dirtiest look i've ever seen.

"What do you need a cane for? you're only a kid..."

He actually got quite pissy just seeing me using a stick. Like, my dude, i'm just out trying to buy some milk, i don't need your s**t today. (i didn't say that out loud, i just said it to myself after i got home)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319580.jpg">

13. Maybe 22 years ago, I had a phone interview with a baking company. I didn’t care to have my peers know what I was up to so I took the call on my cell phone in my car. The call was crystal clear and no technical issues.

At one point, they had mentioned the weather and asked how it was where I was. I told him that I was sitting in my car and I could see that it was actively snowing and what not. The interviewer asked me, “are you taking this call on a cell phone?”
I told him I was. Then he asked me if I thought that was appropriate. I asked him what he meant by that. He said he thought it was kind of rude to take a formal call on a cell phone. I told him I would be more than happy to conclude the interview if talking on a cell phone was an issue. If he was interested, I’d be happy to continue it the next day when I’d be at a desk. He again repeated how rude he thought it was that I had called from a cell phone and that there was no need to continue the interview process. I disagreed with the first point but did agree with the second.

To this day, I wonder what the hell he was talking about and where he was coming from.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319581.jpg">

14. I worked at a restaurant and we put up some Halloween decorations. We had to take them all down when someone found the glittery skull decoration offensive.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319588.jpg">

15. It's specific to France. In french we have a way to address for a man (Monsieur), a married woman (Madame), an unmarried woman (Mademoiselle) and we use to have one for an unmarried man (Mondamoiseau) wich disappeard from official paperworks since i don't even know when.

In the name of gender equality, "mademoiselle" was also removed a few years ago from official paperwork. Also in the name of gender equality some employee were told to not call young women "Mademoiselle" anymore and to go with "Madame".

So the trick is, some women will get offended when called "Madame" because it makes them feel old and some women will get offended when called "Mademoiselle" because it's sexist. Clerks a doomed.

16. >Professor Greg Patton at the University of Southern California (USC) was telling students in a communications lecture last month about filler, or pause words, such as 'err', 'umm' or 'you know' in English.
>
>Footage of his lecture, which has now gone viral, shows Prof Patton saying: "In China, the common pause word is 'that, that, that'. So in China, it might be na-ge, na-ge, na-ge."
>
>Enunciated, na-ge sounds like the N-word, which led several of the professor's students to complain to the university. Responding to the complaint, the dean of the university, Geoffrey Garrett, told students that Prof Patton would no longer be teaching the course.
>
>"It is simply unacceptable for the faculty to use words in class that can marginalize, hurt and harm the psychological safety of our students," he said.
>
>The university says that Prof Patton "volunteered to step away" from his role amid the investigation into complaints made against him.

This is the stupidest thing to get offended over that I've seen in quite a while. And damaging to actual cases of racist terminology being used inappropriately.

17. When I was a child, my mum paid for something with a cheque. The cashier remarked that my mum had nice hand writing
My mum flew off the handle, and we had to storm out of the shop in outrage.
To this day, I have no idea what happened.

18. One of my coworkers was surprised and said “Oh my god”.

A religious coworker overheard her using ‘god’s name in vain’ and reported it to HR. They had to have meetings with HR and the managers about respecting people’s religion. The lady said ‘oh my god’ she didn’t wish for the death of Christianity for f**k’s sake! It was ridiculous.

19. I got in trouble in kindergarten for saying the word dead. Apparently it was too violent.

20. I was at the vet with my cat and he sneezed. This was apperently very offensive to an elder woman (she was there with a corgi) and she started screaming at me for about 30 minutes about pet hygiene.

21. wearing a mask in public

22. We used an app at work called Bonfyre. One person refused to use it because bonfires are for witchcraft and pagans.

23. When I worked in customer service:


"Yes ma'am"

...

"don't you ma'am me. don't you F*****G MA'AM ME YOU PIECE OF S**T!"

24. I had a coworker who got mad at me because I asked her not to tickle me.

(a) That's inappropriate at work; (b) we're not children, we're not in a relationship, we're not family; (c) I DON'T LIKE BEING TICKLED.

She flipped out and said everyone likes being tickled and I was being mean to her. Happily my boss had my back.

Edit: this happened over a decade ago, I don't work with that woman or for that company. In fact, even the company doesn't exist anymore.

I am also a woman.

The coworker was very young and immature. This was her first job, her first time in a professional environment, and she really had no clue about professional workplace behavior. I wasn't upset because she truly thought she was being friendly.

But I still don't like being tickled.

25. My dad loves to tell the story of how, shortly after they were married, he and mom went to get some fast food. As they pulled up to the drive through window, my very conservative mom saw a sign that said "Condiments available upon request" and said "OMG, that's disgusting! WHY would a restaurant feel the need to give those out!?" She had misread it and thought they were giving out condoms upon request.

26. The guy who got offended in a council meeting because someone used the term "black hole".

27. I spent 9 hours deep-cleaning the house for an inspection. I went above and beyond, clearing my work schedule and going the extra mile, and my roommate “double checked” my work. He had a complete psychotic meltdown because I forgot to sweep *underneath* the couch.

I moved out the next day and never spoke to him again.

28. My mom got mad because and I quote "she never asks me for money" referring to me. I'm sorry, would you rather I constantly bug you for cash so I can buy candy and s**t?

29. The Pixar short Lava. He walked out saying it was deeply offensive and didn't explain why.

30. One Easter Sunday, a lady in church was wearing a hat that had the Easter Bunny, chicks, and colored eggs as part of its design.

The woman in the pew behind her took umbrage, telling the lady that Easter was about the *resurrection of Jesus from the dead*, not about "silly rabbits, chicks, and eggs."
