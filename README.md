## <a href="#link2" id="link1">Woman Quits Job To Breastfeed Boyfriend</a>
1. Mulford reportedly took time off from her bartending job so she could focus on feeding her boyfriend every two hours.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049659.jpg">

2. Technically speaking she’s not feeding him yet, as she predicts it will take two months to get her maids a milking, but they’re already practicing with “dry feeding” which is exactly as creepy as it sounds.

How did we get to this point?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049660.jpg">

3. She was single and became interested in Adult Breastfeeding Relationships (ABR) after reading about them and getting jealous of the bond breastfeeding can create between two people who aren't related.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049661.jpg">

4. She started searching for men who would be open to the idea of adult breastfeeding, but feared she might “never get to try adult breastfeeding.”And what a shame that would be.But don’t worry, guys! She found a latch match!Meet Brad, an old boyfriend from school, who when they were talking brought up the fact he was a breast man, giving Mulford a window of opportunity.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049662.jpg">

5. Brad crashed right through that window, even doing his own research, and Mulford said she knew she had “found a partner for life.”

“We both wanted the same thing out of the relationship – a magical bond that only breastfeeding can achieve,” she said. “I’ve taken a break from my job because I want to devote everything to making this work.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049663.jpg">

6. In addition to her "pumping," she drinks Mother's Milk tea three times a day, takes an herbal pill, Lactiful, and eats oatmeal as well as flax seeds in order to increase her milk supply.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049664.jpg">

7. Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no...They even set an alarm so they can “feed” during the night.

“Nights have been a struggle because Brad sleeps so peacefully but we manage to cope – until he falls asleep latched onto me, which is beautiful,” she admitted.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049665.gif">

8. The couple hope to get married in the near future, but they have ruled out having any children together (probably because she can't produce enough milk for anyone else).
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049666.jpg">

9. And there’s an added bonus for Brad, who as a self-confessed “gym buff,” is excited about the health benefits he’ll receive from Jennifer’s milk.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049667.jpg">

10. “He is a real alpha male," she said, "but behind closed doors this relationship lets him put his guard down, be submissive and allow himself to be loved 100 percent.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049668.jpg">

11. I’m sure that will go over real well with the guys at the gym. Do you even latch, bro?

At any rate, she draws the line at doing it in public because it’s very private for her except when it’s plastered all over the Internet.

“I’ll never say never but I love the time we spend nursing alone,” she said. “It’s our time away from the rest of the world and I look forward to every feed.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049669.jpg">

12.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85049670.jpg">

13. I imagine she’s the one who makes the coffee in the morning — or at least supplies the creamer.

1. I've found a meteorite in Kansas. There is an area outside of Greensburg that is known to have had a meteor explode in the air before hitting the earth and dozens of smaller fragments are scattered over many miles. They are very deep and a lot of work to dig up, but my dad and I dug a 7 foot hole and extracted a nearly 30 pound stony-iron pallasite meteorite, which is worth nearly $2,000 a pound.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257740.jpg">

2. My buddy and I bought metal detectors during lockdown and went to the local lake to hunt. I s**t you not he found a silver grill. Not a barbeque, a set of silver teeth in the sand of the local beach. We quit metal detecting right then and there lol

3. Literally only did it once with a friend when I was a teenager at a beach with a friend (he and his dad were really into it). We found a $20k watch in 1995 dollars. Wasn’t a Rolex, but can’t remember the maker. We took it to a jeweler who made a few calls and found out it was in a registry and the owner was called. He was elated as it was a gift from his wife. He sent us each a check for $1,000. The jeweler gave us each a bitchin fake gold chain on the spot. Jean shorts and high tops need the perfect neck accessory and we got it!

5. Some German metal detecting / WWII enthusiasts actually found pieces of my grandfather’s B-24 Liberator that he was shot down in. They were able to ID the plane by its serial numbers. Miraculously, my uncle was on the same forum they were posting their finds on and connected. They sent my grandfather the pieces of his plane.

6. Not my thing, but my brother was detecting just downstream from a popular swimming hole on the American River in California a couple of years ago, looking for dropped watches, phones, go pros, etc. Got a hit, flipped a rock, and found an 11.5-ounce gold nugget underneath. Miners tore the hell out of those rivers back in the 1849 Gold Rush, and amateurs have been panning it ever since, so it was pretty freaking incredible to find something that big.

7. Bit of a cheat as was working a site on a uni course in Northern England. Discovered the end of a Roman Dagger and a relatively intact boot replete with nails. Also found a beautiful fragment of a glass bangle; beautiful turquoise blue glass with a bright yellow wave pattern painted on it. Fellow student found and urn full of silver coins. Jammy git.

8. Work on a farm - a metal detector found a coin under a tree which was 600 years old and in almost perfect condition- as if it had fallen out of someone's pocket as they sat and had lunch after planting the tree.

10. 15 years ago, me and my siblings found a bomb from World War II in the Belgian Ardennes, using a $30 toy metal detector.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257746.jpg">

I remember walking off-road in the woods for hours until we found a spot that looked like nobody has been there in ages. We quickly found a couple of bullets and, while I was inspecting the bullets, my younger brother age 9 saw something sticking out of the dirt.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257747.jpg">

At first, we thought it was a rusty metal can, but when he pulled it out, it took us a moment to realize that he was holding a bomb. We didn’t know whether it was still intact so I instructed him to slowly put it down in a way that it could not roll off the hill and hit something.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257748.jpg">

We didn’t have any mobile phones so we rushed to the nearest road which we followed to get to a village to get help. We marked the trees so we would remember where we had hidden the bomb.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257749.jpg">

When we arrived at the village, we explained what happened. Luckily, they believed our story and called the local police. When he arrived, we couldn’t understand a word he said (he was speaking French, we only spoke Dutch) — but eventually he would follow us deep into the woods.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257751.jpg">

When we arrived, the bomb was luckily still there, and after an inspection by the police officer we were instructed to leave as apparently it was too dangerous and had to be picked up by the bomb squad — but not before we snapped a picture for the local press, posing with the bomb next to us. I still have that picture.

11. I found a blacksmith’s shop in the middle of a farmers field. I was detecting for a historical society and their local expert told me to detect a certain spot that he calculated where the blacksmith shop would be. I did a 10x10 foot area with only finding small pieces of slag. I wasn’t convinced that the shop was there, but the expert wouldn’t have it. While everyone took a break at noon. I started a spiral pattern going farther and farther from his calculations. About 30 minutes later and 100 feet away, I got good strong signals and large slag pieces. I even found a single clay brick. One of the society members started an excavation at my spot. They eventually hit the corner of the shops foundation. They found a hammer and tools for the anvil and the rest of the blacksmith shop.

12. A few weeks ago I was driving on a country road near my house. There was a car pulled over to the side and a young couple was walking around obviously looking for something. I stopped and asked if they needed help. The girl told me, "We were arguing and I threw a ring out of the window." Seeing the guy was beyond pissed, I told them good luck and I drove off. A few days later I got to thinking to borrow a metal detector from a friend who is into that. Went back and searched for about an hour, getting ready to call it quits when I found the ring. Sadly, I have no idea who the couple was and just hope they are OK now.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257755.jpg">

13. I took a metal detector to my grandparents’ garden when I was 10 and found some Civil War canister shot. Goddamned if it didn’t get lost in a move a few years later. Never found anything as cool as that since then.

To make up for that, I spent the next ten years poring over war-era battle maps showing the positions of each regiment and battery over the course of a particular major battle that basically crisscrossed the whole area, comparing with modern topo maps, doing serious deep dives into primary sources, etc. Eventually, I figured out the exact hill the grapeshot had likely been fired from, and the side that fired it.

I’m glad I got to experience finding it, at least, even though it got lost. It played a big role in my turning into a big history nerd early on.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257738.jpg">

14. I used to live near the railroad tracks near an airport and an old industrial area. They used to have a local station for the workers to shuttle into the area (late 1800's, early 1900's). They eventually tore down the station in the 30's/40's when the highways got built nearby.
My dad used to take me with metal detectors and we would find railroad spikes, pocket watches, wrist watches, old silver
​dollars and other coins. Best haul by far was a gold locket with a picture of someone's wife/girlfriend ensribed "All My Love, Annie". It wasn't the prettiest locket, but you bet your bottom dollar someone was kicking themselves for losing that precious treasure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87257756.jpg">

15. Usually just found lose change people lost at the beach. However, I did have to go find a diamond ring once. Wife of a friend who was currently deployed CLAIMS she lost it while at the beach with her GIRLFRIENDS. It took me a day, but I was able to find it. She was appreciative. It wasn't until he got back that I found out that she lost it because she was taking it off while dating other men. I hated her ever since for playing me like that.
