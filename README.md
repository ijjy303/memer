## <a href="#link10" id="link9">22 Low-Tech Ways To Stay Warm Without Wasting Energy This Winter</a>
1. In the morning, open curtains and raise blinds so sunlight can flow in. Window glass permits light to pass through but doesn't let it back out. As it infiltrates the room, bouncing off walls and furniture, the light becomes heat. FREE heat.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398418.jpg">

2. At night, use thick curtains to prevent heat from escaping Once the light disappears, windows become the enemy. Heat escapes quickly through single pane glass, common in older homes and apartments. Keep it inside by upcycling old sheets and blankets into roll-down thermal curtains
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398419.jpg">

3. Fortify window frames with caulk to eliminate leaks. Caulking window frames only costs a few dollars and can be done in minutes. It's a small job that adds up to big savings, especially in older, drafty houses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398420.jpg">

4. Take it one step further with DIY bubble wrap insulation. All you need is some leftover sheets of bubble wrap, an Exacto knife, and a spray bottle full of water, and you could reduce window heat loss by 50%.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398421.jpg">

5. Cover bare floor boards with area rugs.There's nothing more unpleasant than setting your bare feet down on a freezing cold floor first thing in the morning. Adding area rugs actually creates another layer of insulation, trapping the cool air underneath and so it can't creep up and cool the room. Your bare feet will thank you too.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398422.jpg">

6. Use weather stripping to eliminate air leaks around door frames.Weather stripping is a cheap way to seal up the gaps around doors and windows through which precious heat loves to escape. Adding it can save you 10 to 15 percent on your energy bills.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398423.jpg">

7. Add a panel of aluminum foil behind old radiators or wall mounted heaters. This hack uses high quality kitchen foil or, for a bit more, special radiator foil to reflect more heat back into the room rather than letting it escape through the walls.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398424.jpg">

8. If you have a programmable thermostat, USE IT. The goal is to never manually adjust your thermostat. According to Energy.gov, thermostats should be programmed for 56 degrees at night and when the house is empty during the day. Then, program it to increase to about 68 degrees during the times when you'll be at home. This one small action can save 5 to 15 percent on your heating bill each year!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398425.jpg">

9. Shower with the door open.Obviously, this is easier if you live alone or with a significant other. The warm, humid air created by the shower will help to raise the temperature of the whole house.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398426.gif">

10. Air dry some of your laundry. This will save you money two ways: 1 just like showering with the door open, air drying clothes increases humidity, which makes the house feel warmer. 2 You won't have to run the electric dryer as long or maybe at all! thus using less expensive energy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398427.jpeg">

11. Reverse your ceiling fan direction, and make sure to switch it on anytime you're using the heat. This helps push warm air that's risen to the ceiling back down to the floor where you can feel it. The less that's wasted, the less demand there is on heating systems and the more you save.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398428.jpg">

12. Consider a chimney balloon. Do you have a fireplace that doesn't work or barely gets used? A chimney balloon acts as inflatable, removable and reusable plug to stop cold chimney drafts from entering your home.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398429.jpg">

13. Wrap your water heater tank in a nice warm blanket. Insulating your water tank, will reduce standby heat losses and save you about 50 percent in water heating costs, and should pay for itself in about a year, according to Energy.gov.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398430.jpg">

14. Don't forget to show hot water pipes a little TLC as well. Insulating your hot water pipes reduces heat loss, which means you can save money by setting your water heater to a lower temperature. You also won't have to wait as long for hot water when showering on cold winter mornings!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398431.jpg">

15. Use the leftover pipe foam as a door draft stopper.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398432.jpg">

16. Make a Tea Candle Space Heater using a couple of ceramic flower pots and a tea candle, you can DIY a space heater that will keep a small room warm for about 12 cents a day.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398433.jpg">

17. Wear extra layers in the house. When you feel a chill, reach for a sweater instead of thermostat. With the extra layers, your body will heat up much faster than the furnace can heat your house.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398434.jpg">

18. Once you're bundled up, sip on something hot. Drink lots of tea, coffee, hot chocolate and other warm liquids including soup! will raise your body temperature in a jiffy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398435.jpg">

19. Do a little baking. Holidays are a great time for baking breads, cookies, and cakes. When you're done, leave the oven door open to recycle some of that heat! Note: don't be an idiot, if you've got little kids or mischievous pets, this may not be a safe option.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398436.jpeg">

20. Make a bed warmer and never suffer through frigid sheets again! Electric blankets can be dangerous and suck up costly electricity. Transform a couple of old sheets into a microwaveable bedwarmer instead.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398437.jpg">

21. If that's too complicated, sleeping with a hot water bottle works just as well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2165492/84398438.jpg">

22. If all else fails, chilly nights are a great excuse to get your cuddle on.

1. Sleep paralysis audio / visual hallucinations across cultures throughout history. It’s disturbing. -u/Trek1973
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275676.jpg">

2. Cryptozoology. Its interesting to say the least but there are so many things that make you question what is out there in the world that we haven’t discovered yet. When I first got into it I thought cryptids were more like Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster but there are hundreds or even thousands of other weird and unusual sightings of creatures many haven’t even heard of. -u/odagled86

3. Caving and Cave Diving accidents. Accidentally watched one in YouTube, then went down the rabbit hole. This led to some more parallel topics of horrible fates, bad deaths etc. After few days, started getting disturbed sleep as this became my routine of watching before the sleep time. With self restraint, finally I got out of it. -u/insomniac_observer

6. Fire disasters. And then never feel safe in an indoor crowded space ever again.There's actually video on YouTube of the Great White disaster and it's utterly horrifying how incredibly quickly it happens and seeing the people literally stuck in the doorway unable to get out as they burn to death. As someone who still goes to a lot of shows at small packed music venues exactly like that one (and other totally packed bars and clubs), I'm always constantly looking for exits to find the nearest escape path and it always freaks me out anytime there's any fire in any indoor space (candles/sparklers/pyrotechnics/etc). -u/SquareVehicle

8. Mass hysteria. There are different kinds that have affected different cultures in different ways. Multiple times throughout history, groups of people have uncontrollably danced themselves to deaths. In other parts of the world, men can become stricken with the belief that their penis is receding into their bodies; it was often believed the only way to prevent this from happening overnight was for family members to hold their members, etc. -u/tullyinturtleterror

10. The times where we have gotten close to extinction. There was a false report from a Russian radar thingy and they thought that nukes were coming to them from America, if it wasn’t for one person Nuclear Armageddon would’ve happened because of a software glitch (Another good one is how some horrible stuff like cannibalism is legal in certain scenarios). -u/Bagel_RR

12. Post-WWII industries. Take fertilizer, lawn care, and home gardening for example.A very specific push to get chemical fertilizers in every home, monoculture lawns that require a lot more input, and a “clean” lawn that has left us where we are now.Very silly that we strayed away from what we had previously… -u/CheeseChickenTable

15. The town of Skidmore, Missouri in the US.It's sort of a small topic, but it leads in so many different directions. It's most famous for the murder of the town bully (that's a mild name for him; he was horrible) in the middle of the day, on the main street, with a bunch of witnesses, but no one has ever been arrested. But there's also the later case of a woman who was murdered and her unborn baby stolen and even later a teenager (who was related to the murdered woman) just disappeared and is thought to have been taken by a serial killer.All this in a town of fewer than 200 people. I'm not superstitious, but I also wouldn't move there.There is a documentary on Sundance about the bully, but the best introduction is a book called In Broad Daylight. From there, you just get farther and farther down tangential paths, trying to figure out wtf happened. Less info on the two later cases, but still an internet black hole you can fall into for days. -u/secondhandbanshee

16. The history of lobotomies and cannibalism. I have spent more time researching these topics than the time taken to write a 90-page essay. Super fascinating if you don't get grossed out. -u/Sure_Pangolin_9421

17. The domino effect that led up to World War One and then later World War Two. It’s interesting to learn about but it’s just a clusterf*ck of easily preventable situations. -u/Jazzlike-Dog-2999
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275693.jpg">

18. Shipwrecks. Been absolutely obsessed with them the past few days, there’s so much to discover and learn about and so much corruption as well as just interesting circumstances that these huge machines go down in.And adding to that, technical diving accidents. Especially in shipwrecks. You can dive down to the sunken Andrea Doria (that wrecked because another enormous ship collided sideways into it!) ship and collect first-class dinnerware as plunder, but people have died, seemingly becoming lost in the complete darkness of the halls inside, or user error in ANY capacity, such as not having the correct oxygen tank levels leading to hallucinations and false confidence that makes you drown. -u/uglysquire

22. People who go missing. This one I'm particularly fascinated with for some reason. Maybe it's because I like this YouTuber and how he formats his videos, but I've watched this video about a missing Canadian girl three times:https://youtu.be/AzLqFYyY0bMPersonally, I think she was groomed by a dude she met online and that guy kidnapped her and is holding her captive, like the Josef guy from Austria years back. -u/Karnezar
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87275698.jpg">

23. Art forgery and fakes. I’ve been watching a BBC series called Fake or Fortune where people try to get their art validated as being by an old master (They’ve had Renoir, Monet, etc). The program goes into how both modern-day and historic forgers use techniques to make a picture or sculpture look original.It sometimes also shows how corrupt the art validation world can be, with one episode showing overwhelming evidence that a picture was genuine, but the organization responsible for cataloging the original works of the artist refuses to acknowledge it.Interestingly the head of that institute is now under investigation in France for hoarding €1bn worth of “missing” artworks. -u/mbfos

24. Ask A Mortician on Youtube.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi5iiEyLwSLvlqnMi02u5gQCaitlin Doughty tells fascinating stories of unusual deaths, cannibalism, historic shipwrecks/accidents, botched cremations, etc. She also has three books out on death questions and the funeral business that I've read more than once.-u/WitchInYourGarden
