## <a href="#link9" id="link8">World's Richest Sea Turtle "Assaulted and Robbed"</a>
1.  This female turtle wasn't able to eat because her belly was full of coins.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288066.jpg">

2. Nearly 1,000 coins were removed from the green sea turtle, who survived four hours of surgery Monday to have them removed from her digestive tract.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288067.jpg">

3. The surgery wasn’t easy going. After turtle was anesthetized, a 10-centimeter opening was cut into the bottom of her shell. The doctors were unable to remove the coins that way, so they had to cut into her stomach to remove the coins, making sure not to tear the delicate lining of the turtle’s abdomen.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288068.jpg">

4. The vets decided to name the Turtle, "Piggy Bank".
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288069.jpg">

5. The doctors said this was the world’s first surgery to remove coins from a green sea turtle and that Piggy Bank will remain for one to two weeks.  When Piggy Bank is completely recovered, she will be released back into the ocean.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288070.jpg">

6. It seems the turtle ate coins that people left "to come back for them" or "for luck". Many tourists trow coins in the water not thinking about the animals that live there.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288071.jpg">

7. The team was unable to estimate the total value of Piggy Bank’s internal wealth, as many of the coins were in other currencies or had corroded beyond recognition.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85288072.jpg">

8. The doctors said they hope people will learn a lesson from this and treat nature with much more respect.

2. John Pemberton, the inventor of Coca Cola, did so because he was chronically addicted to morphine and was trying to get off of it. Original ingredients were cocaine (famously), sugar, alcohol, and caffeine. He was trying to supplant his other addiction. It did not work. -Nightjar82

4. F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife, Zelda, told him that the way he was built, he would never please a woman.

6. Anne Frank's journal, or at least the editions most commonly seen around the English-speaking world, is heavily censored by it's publisher.
