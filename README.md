5. The Apollo 1 Tragedy:
the orbit with Virgil “Gus” Grissom, Edward White and Roger Chaffee on board. Tragically, however, the spacecraft was destroyed in a cabin fire during a launch pad test 50 years ago.
On January 27, 1967 Apollo 1 was sitting on the launch pad atop a Saturn 1B rocket at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34, the precursor to the Saturn V. It was set to perform a “plugs-out” test, during which both the launch vehicle and the spacecraft were not loaded with fuel and all pyrotechnic systems were disabled. The task was merely to prepare Apollo 1 for its launch on February 21, 1967 by running through various system procedures.
During the second run through the checklist, the fire started. The 100% oxygen atmosphere fed the electrical fire, the increasing pressure rupturing the capsule wall. Shrapnel injured ground crew, while smoke billowed out to smother them. Within 26 seconds, the horrified ground team heard garbled voices yelling, and saw flame sweeping across the camera. It took five full minutes for the ground crew to peel open all three hatches, trading off as heat and smoke forced them to retreat.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Survival Tips That Could Save Your Life</a>
1. The emergency signal SOS in morse code is 3xshort 3xlong 3xshort. The alpine emergency signal is 1 short signal every 10 seconds for a minute, followed by a one-minute pause. (Confirmation answer is 3 short signals)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295677.jpg">

2. If someone pulls a gun on you DON'T allow them to take you to a different location. Run away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295680.jpg">

3. If you are buried under snow, rubble or debris, it's wise to pee yourself. The smell will make it easier for search dogs to find you faster.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295670.jpg">

4. If you're ever alone and get something stuck in your throat 'til you can't breathe, throw yourself backward against a wall or any hard vertical surface. Do it 'til it dislodges the object.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295664.jpg">

5. A small Swiss Army knife or Leatherman comes in handy for unexpected situations, especially if it comes with small pliers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295666.jpg">

6. If you're going through thick woods and you want to get out into a clearing, look at the treetops. You can notice clearings better than looking through the trees at eye level.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295667.jpg">

7. A car 'emergency kit' with basic tools, long-life foods, battery bank and charging cables, flashlight and an inflatable pillow.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295669.jpg">

8. If stranded in the desert, NEVER drink cactus water. It's too acidic to be useful and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, or even temporary paralysis. Not fun. Additionally, find a place in the shade during the day and travel at night.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295672.jpg">

9. Always carry three items with you no matter what: A lighter, a foil emergency blanket, and a cheap rain poncho in a packet. These take up very little space even in pockets, provide fire, shelter, and in the case of the foil blanket, also a signal device.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295673.jpg">

10. If your hair ever starts to stand up when you are outside, run, and run like HECK! You might be struck by lightning.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295674.jpg">

11. If you're hiking in cold weather and start to sweat, stop and remove some layers until you feel cool again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295675.jpg">

12. Stay away from glass office windows if you hear a ruckus going on outside. Bombers lure people to the windows by creating disturbances outside.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295678.jpg">

13. In your car: have a permanent marker in the cup holder, glove box or between the front seat pocket. If anything happens, write it on the glass window, rearview mirror, on your hand. Pens & pencils are unreliable.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295679.jpg">

14. Always keep a jar of peanut butter in your vehicle. Lots of calories and it lasts along time without spoiling.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295668.jpg">

15. If you find water, DON'T DRINK IT. Boil it first then use it for tea. Or you could also use one of those tablets that purify water. This kills all the bacteria in it so it's safe to drink.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295681.jpg">

16. When you go hiking, wear proper equipment, preferably hiking/combat boots with long laces. If you tie the laces tightly around your foot the chances of you spraining your ankle lessens.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295682.jpg">

17. I always make sure my gas tank is more than half full, (especially in the winter). Carry printed maps, peanut butter, a gallon of water, crackers, an extra coat, pillow, blanket, and a whole extra outfit including shoes. Also have jumper cables, tire plug kit, and some basic tools.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295683.jpg">

18. If you live in a place that gets tornadoes, keep a loud whistle wherever you take shelter. If you get trapped under debris, a whistle is louder than yelling and doesn't take as much energy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295665.jpg">

19. Always have baking soda at hand near the stove to put out fires. Never put out a fire on the stove or oven with water, in case there's grease.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87295685.jpg">

20. Know your exits. In a fire or other disaster most people will head for the door they came in.
