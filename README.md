1. Richard Pierce – 14 years of age, works as a Western Union Telegraph Messenger. with nine months of service. He works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. Smokes. Visits houses of prostitution. Wilmington, Delaware, ca. May 1910
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85315628.jpg">

2. Adolf Hitler, Along with Mussolini’s son-in-law, Count Galeazzo Ciano (to Hitler’s right), and Joachim von Ribbentrop, attend a NSDAP (Nazi Party) 1930s.

Count Galeazzo Ciano was, from the very beginning, against the notion of Italy entering a war; he believed Italy was ill prepared for such an undertaking. As his doubts grew, Ciano would take increasingly bold actions; prior to the German invasion of France, for example, he warned the Belgian government of an imminent German invasion of Belgium. In 1942 and 1943, when the situation looked dire, Ciano turned his efforts towards Italy’s withdrawal from the conflict. For this, he was removed from his post as Foreign Minister on February 5th, 1943. He would remain under close watch of his father-in-law, Mussolini. Following Mussolini’s arrest and Italy’s change of heart, Ciano sought refuge in Germany. There he did not find it; Ciano was rebuffed by the Germans and tried by the fsacist Italians, who found him guilty of treason. Count Ciano was executed by firing squad under the order of his father in law, Benito Mussolini, on January 11th, 1944. His last words were “Long Live Italy!”
