3. Robert F. Kennedy’s wife, Ethel, attempts to comfort him as lay mortally wounded on floor of the kitchen in the Ambassador Hotel. June 6, 1968.

“We judge the United States of America by [the size of our economy, when that number] . . . does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play; it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.”
-Robert F. Kennedy.

4. American soldier standing in the ruined Monument to the Battle of Nations in Leipzig, Germany, 1945.

A U.S. soldier stands in the middle of rubble in the Monument of the Battle of the Nations in Leipzig after they attacked the city on April 18, 1945. The huge monument commemorating the defeat of Napoleon in 1813 was one of the last strongholds in the city to surrender. One hundred and fifty SS fanatics with ammunition and foodstuffs stored in the structure to last three months dug themselves in and were determined to hold out as long as their supplies. American First Army artillery eventually blasted the SS troops into surrender.

5. Russian Imperial family – circa 1914.

When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George’s first cousin, was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British government offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening conditions for the British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George to think that the presence of the Russian royals would be seen as inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was George V who opposed the rescue against the advice of the government. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were killed by Bolsheviks in 1918. King George V essentially signing his owns cousin’s death certificate.

7. Richard and Mildred Loving. The Supreme Court ruled interracial marriage bans unconstitutional in the case of Loving vs Virginia – June 12, 1967.

The Ruling:
Marriage is one of the “basic civil rights of man,” fundamental to our very existence and survival…. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85394609.jpg">

13. While John and Clarence Anglin, 2 of the 3 men who ever escaped from Alcatraz, were officially reported to have drowned in the bay, their mother received flowers anonymously every Mother’s Day until she died, and two very tall unknown women were reported to have attended her funeral.

According to Unsolved Mysteries, a day after the escape a man claiming to be John Anglin had called a lawyer in San Francisco and wanted the lawyer to arrange a meeting with the US Marshals’ Office. When the lawyer refused to do this, the person hung up. The sister of the brothers, Marie Anglin Widner, has told the media she believes that the brothers attented their mother’s funeral in 1973, disguised as women. On October 12, 2015, the History Channel premiered a documentary about the 1962 Alcatraz escape, focusing on John and Clarence Anglin and the possibility that their escape was successful. The program, Alcatraz: Search for the Truth provided viewers with evidence kept by the brothers’ family that included: Christmas cards signed by “John” and “Clarence”; an audio tape of a childhood family friend, Fred Brizzi, telling the family in the early 1990s about a chance encounter in 1975 with the brothers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; a photograph taken by the same family friend in 1975 of two men resembling John and Clarence Anglin.

## <a href="#link7" id="link6">15 People Reveal Secrets These Big Companies Don’t Want You to Know</a>
1. “Printer ink cartridges are meant to signal that they’re empty after a certain number of pages, even if they still have some ink left.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465001.jpg">

2. “A lot of people probably know that when a tv show goes into syndication that some scenes will be cut from episodes to make them slightly shorter, to fit in more commercials.What people don’t know is that the show can be slightly sped up as well, to squeeze in just a little more advertising.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465002.jpg">

3. “You use too much dawn dish soap. That stuff is ridiculously concentrated.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465003.jpg">

4. “Grocery store bakeries do not bake the cakes they decorate. That stuff comes in frozen. Stop asking me to bake you a carrot cake. On top of that most of the baking in grocery store bakeries is just pulling frozen pastries or muffins or whatever out of a box and panning it up, then putting it in the proofer /oven. We don’t really make things anymore.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465004.jpg">

5. “At Subway my manager never once bought real mayonnaise. The Light Mayo and the Real Mayo are both Light Mayo. Investigate those fuckers.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465005.jpg">

6. “In sofa/couch commercials they use smaller actors/models to make the sofas/couches look bigger.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465006.jpg">

7. “Nearly every caller you hear on top 40 radio is either a intern or someone else close to the studio, everything is fake. Especially that war of the roses shit.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465007.jpg">

8. “Every programmer in the world occasionally writes a very bad code that sticks with the app/program forever.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465008.jpg">

9. “A bottle of Windex is basically 95% water 4% ammonia, and 1% blue dye / fragrance. The most expensive part of the product is the bottle.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465009.jpg">

10. “As call center employee I can assure you that ALL of our calls are recorded not for training purposes, but to protect our own asses.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465010.jpg">

11. “It feels like it shouldn’t be a secret, but a lot of people just don’t get it. If you find yourself waiting forever to be seen in the ER, that’s probably a very good thing. We get the serious stuff back there pretty dang quick.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465011.jpg">

12. “I attended a songwriting workshop at berklee school of music, and Anna Wise (Grammy winning songwriter, Kendrick Lamar collaborator) told the audience during a presentation that whenever someone “magically” blows up on soundcloud or YouTube, that it’s not authentic. A label will sign the artist in secret, and then suddenly boost their viewership tremendously to make it look like the independent artist did it on their own.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465012.jpg">

13. Ask to have the late fee waived. I literally cannot do anything with it until you specifically ask.
“So you have a late fee of $30 on this.”
“Gee that’s a lot. Why is it so much?”
“That’s the late fee we have. I do apologize for that inconvenience.”
“Well I guess I’ll have to pay it then…”
“Ok, so your bill is $150.”
“Do you realize how much that is?”
“Yes, and I do apologize for the inconvenience.”
“Well, can you do something about it?”
Yes. Now I can because you asked. Please stop making me feel guilty that you paid your bill late.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465013.jpg">

14. “My sister was on The Biggest Loser. Jillian and Bob were there two maybe three days a week. They make it seem like they live there.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85465014.jpg">

15. “Merlin Entertainments, the company that runs a wide variety of midway attractions like Legoland Discovery Centers as well as Legoland itself, pays most of their American employees less than Walmart. Oftentimes, employees love the job, but ultimately can’t afford to keep it. This causes a near 90% turnover rate.”
