7. Deconstructing the Bull.

Picasso’s The Bull, created in late 1945, reveals how a great artist turns an idea into a masterpiece. Starting the series with a realistic drawing of a bull, Picasso used the following 10 lithographs to mutate and dissect its form, stripping away details and stylizing its anatomy. In the end, Picasso turned a highly literal representation of a bull into an intertwined series of abstract elements that balance and counterbalance each other to make up a powerful and expressive work of art. The last image is a single sinuous line that is still unmistakably a bull.

## <a href="#link3" id="link2">30 Major Life Traps To Avoid</a>
1. Just because you have spare money at the end of the month doesn’t mean you need to spend it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319012.jpg">

2. Comparing yourself to others. Comparison is the thief of joy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319018.jpg">

3. Thinking that you're running out of time to do something because someone else has done it already.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319019.jpg">

4. Marrying or living with or otherwise committing to someone who is mean to you and doesn’t treat you well.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319020.jpg">

5. Waiting too long for "perfect," like the perfect soulmate, house, job, etc., and then letting too many good opportunities pass by.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319013.jpg">

6. Obsession with physical appearance. This has plagued my life and I’ve never felt satisfied with how I look. Be kind to yourself and others.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319021.jpg">

7. Doing nothing becouse of fear of rejection.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319022.jpg">

8. Having an elaborate expensive wedding that does nothing but stress everyone out and bankrupt you.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319023.jpg">

9. Having kids bc society said you should. Nothing against kids, parents, etc, but the pressure to have kids is immense in most areas.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319024.jpg">

10. Staying in unhealthy relationships because "I've put ten years into this." I beg of you, know your worth.

11. You gotta be your own advocate. If you think other people will fix the problems you have, you're gonna have a bad time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319026.jpg">

12. Lifestyle creep. Feeling the need to upgrade cars, houses, jewelry, etc to keep up with your peers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319015.jpg">

13. Putting things off. We could do it more as kids because someone was there to pick up the slack, or stay on top of you to get something done. But as an adult, the consequences of waiting on stuff slaps you hard.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319027.jpg">

14. Multi-level marketing. Someone got me to go to a seminar and the rhetoric was what a lot of people want to hear about themselves for validation.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319028.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319030.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319031.jpg">

19. Letting other people define success for you rather than defining it for yourself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319032.jpg">

20. Imposter Syndrome. The cure is eventually realizing no one has a clue.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319034.jpg">

21. Sunk cost fallacy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319035.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319036.jpg">

23. My grandfather only ever gave me one piece of advice. "There are 3 things in life that can ruin you. Don't do drugs, Don't gamble, and a good women is very important, a bad one can ruin your life forever." All I can say is too true.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319039.jpg">

26. One of the biggest traps in life is not picking yourself up after a failure. Letting yourself go and sinking to the bottom. Depression will sink in and you’ll start to loose everything. Extremely heartbreaking when you see someone you love go through this.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319040.jpg">

27. Procrastination.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319041.jpg">

28. Not knowing how to use credit cards correctly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87319042.jpg">

29. Toxic relationships. People do them to try and "fix" people, but they just end up getting themselves hurt.

30. Letting regret and fear control you.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Fascinating Photos Collected From History</a>
1. John Dillinger, center, handcuffed to Deputy Sheriff R.M. Pierce during Dillinger’s murder trial hearing in Crown Point, Indiana. Though his trial was scheduled for March 12, 1934, Dillinger would escape from the Crown Point prison on March 3.

The best-known American bank robber of the 20th century was John Dillinger. Although his career lasted only a little more than a year from June 1933 to July 1934 he gained nationwide notoriety as the country’s most wanted criminal.
Dillinger was born in Indianapolis, Ind., on June 28, 1902. He grew up there and in nearby Mooresville. In 1923 he joined the United States Navy but deserted the service within a few months. He reappeared in Mooresville on Sept. 6, 1924, and was caught robbing a store. He served time in Indiana prisons until 1933, becoming a hardened criminal.
Paroled in May 1933, Dillinger formed a gang and set out to rob banks. Captured four months later, he was rescued by gang members. After robberies in several states, he was arrested in Arizona and returned to Indiana and jailed. He executed a remarkable escape on Mar. 3, 1934, and continued his bank robberies. The object of a massive manhunt by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), he was so legend says lured to the Biograph Theater in Chicago on July 22, 1934, by Anna Sage, the mysterious so-called Lady in Red. There FBI agents gunned him down.

Many Japanese were extremely offended by this picture because of how casual MacArthur is looking and standing while next to the Emperor, who was supposed to be a god.
The Japanese government immediately banned the photo of the Emperor with MacArthur under the grounds that it damaged the imperial mystique, but MacArthur rescinded the ban and ordered all of the Japanese newspapers to print it.

19. Rasputin and groupies. Gorokhovo street flat, Saint Petersburg, 1914.

Who was Rasputin and what was his influence?
Rasputin was a religious mystic and faith healer. The heir to the Russian thrown had hemophilia, which at the time was poorly understood and potentially very dangerous. Rasputin was able to stop his bleeding, either by using hypnosis or giving him aspirin. This gave him access to the royal family and influence with the Russian Empress.
During WWI Rasputin prophesied that Russian forces would not be victorious until the Emperor personally led them. This did not go well. Rasputin was later assassinated for unclear reason. He famously took a long time to die and survived through several methods of murder.

1. Well hello, Martian iguana.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715016.jpg">

2. The tip of what appears to be a pyramid on Mars, is supposedly about the size of a small car. Obviously we don't know how much of it is buried though.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715017.jpg">

3. Some are seeing a crouching squirrel in this photo. NASA has said that if there was any life on Mars, it probably never came close to rodent sized.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715018.jpg">

4. This ghostly woman appears to be looking down at the Curiosity rover. NASA says it's probably just a shape made by sand drifts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715019.jpg">

5. Is this a levitating ball?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715020.jpg">

6. Some UFO buffs are claiming that this photo contains a fallen Star Wars like ship.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715021.jpg">

7. This does look an awful like a WWI helmet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715022.jpg">

8. Some people are claiming that this looks like the skull of an alien.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715023.jpg">

9. Isn't it crazy that Sasquatchs are ALWAYS blurry?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715024.jpg">

10. Some are claiming this looks like a dinosaur spine.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715025.jpg">

11. This does look a lot like a human finger.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715026.jpg">

12. There's a shy little lizard in this photo.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715027.jpg">

13. It's actually pretty crazy how much this one looks like a thigh bone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1134907/84715028.jpg">

14. Uh, guys... WTF is that?

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">20 Scientific Facts About Space to Expand Your Mind</a>
1. "There are many many mindboggling facts. My favorite one is always cold welding. Due to lack of oxygen - and in consequence lack of corrosion - you can put two pieces of metal together in the vacuum of space, and they will permanently connect, forming a single piece of metal almost instantly." - myhamsterisajerk

 https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vzlxcd/whats_a_fact_about_space_which_will_always_blow/
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224877.jpg">

2. "Imagine our entire solar system is the size of a beach ball. And you put that beach ball on a beach on the US east coast. The closest "beach ball" to us in the galaxy is on a beach in Portugal. We sent a probe out decades ago and as far as we know, it has only just recently reached the edge of our own beach ball." - seamustheseagull
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224878.jpg">

3. "Space Fabric. Imagine somehow being able to build a spacecraft which can resist any kind of gravity and other critical conditions, then fly inside black hole just beyond event horizon for a split second and fly back, after exit our galaxy likely doesn't exist anymore even from your PoV it was just there few seconds ago and no one knows how many billions of years you've been there from an Earth's time perspective. Or one would simply die together with the universe and the black hole the same second they go beyond the event horizon who knows." - ExacoCGI
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224879.jpg">

4. "That there is enough space between the Earth and our Moon to fit in all the other planets." - decitertiember
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224880.jpg">

5. "The sheer size of it always blows my mind. Just the observable universe is 93 billion light-years in diameter, and it’s estimated that the actual universe is about 250x times that." - CymroCam
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224881.jpg">

6. "The fact that space isn't just the backdrop in which everything occurs. It actually bends in response to gravity. When you see the James Webb pics for example with the gravitational lensing, the light is going "straight" in that's it's doing what light does and taking the shortest path from A to B. However, space is being bent which is why the shortest path is curved. It's wild that it's warping around us." - RPC3
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224882.jpg">

7. "that everything in the universe is actually moving through spacetime at the exact same velocity: C, you, me, a rock, and a photon, are all traveling at the same speed." - EvidenceOfReason
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224883.jpg">

8. "Space," the Hitchhiker's Guide says, "is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space. Listen . . ." and so on." - ShiningRayde
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224884.jpg">

9. "The fact that 'normal' matter only equates to around 5% of the universe as we know it...The rest of it - Dark energy and matter is largely unknown." - huskyhoonigan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224885.jpg">

10. "Pretty much everything you look at isn’t even there anymore" - Special-Conference41
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224886.jpg">

11. "The boötes void. It has a radius of 165 million light years wide, and contains only 60 galaxies in a space that would be expected to have around 2000" - Butter_Garlic_Naan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224887.jpg">

12. "That we sent a robot 35 MILLION miles away. That robot took a selfie and sent it back." - JoaneHan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224888.jpg">

13. "The largest black hole is the size of Jupiter......'s orbit around the sun" - groovy604
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224889.jpg">

14. "That we really went to the fucking moon. Imagine telling that to someone from 500 years ago." - ipakookapi
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224890.jpg">

15. "I wouldn't say fact as it's impossible to know for sure but it's believed that the universe is expanding outwards in three dimensions faster than the speed of light. Further more, if you some how could travel to the edge, what would happen if you continued past it? What's outside of the expanding universe?" - Singulant
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224891.jpg">

16. "And then you realise 10 billion suns could fit in the largest star" - chug-mug
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224892.jpg">

17. "Light cannot bend, however objects that have mass can bend the space around them and if light passes through this space then it appears to bend. Buttttt because light travels at a constant speed and if it travels through this bended space it means that light is taking longer to reach its destination, this is impossible as light cannot slow down and is technically not bending, therefore in this bended space time SLOWS down. Blows my mind everytime I think about it." - mister1bollock
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224893.jpg">

18. "That we will never be able to explore all of it." - roguediamond
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224894.jpg">

19. "I read somewhere that there is no definite center of the universe because it is expanding infinitely in all directions. Thus any point in the universe is a center - making you the center of the universe." - Common-Transition973
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224895.jpg">

20. "A photon released during a super nova in some far off galaxy could have spent billions of years and traveled across the entire universe just to end up hitting someone's butt while they were laying on a beach." - HumpieDouglas
