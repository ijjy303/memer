8. Live suicide.
Fox News was covering a live car chase in in Phoenix when the driver, Jordan Romero, got out of his vehicle and committed suicide. The network immediately apologized for showing it live but it was already too late. Nobody could unsee what they just saw on the live broadcast

9. Oops!

10. Casey Anthony not guilty.
Not since the O.J. Simpson trial was the nation as memorized by a court trial as they were during the Casey Anthony trial. What was expected to be read as a guilty verdict shocked everyone as she was found not guilty.

11. Manila hostage situation.
In 2010, people watched a live broadcast of former Manila police officer Rolando Mendoza taking hostages on a tour bus. In the end eight of the hostages were shot and killed as the cameras were on the bus. Since the event took place inside of the bus the cameras did not catch the murders.

12. Earnhardt dies at Daytona.
In 2001 at the Daytona 500, racing fans watched as Dale Earnhardt's car slammed into the wall and he was killed. Earnhardt was arguably the most popular driver in racing and the race was one of the biggest of the year. The crash didn't look to be that bad but it didn't take long to realize that it was.

13. A tense landing.
In 2005, we watched live as JetBlue Flight 292 was in trouble while landing. The difference in this event was that the passengers on the plane were actually able to watch the live television broadcast on their in seat televisions. All of the televisions were turned off just before the plane actually landed but they all knew they were in trouble.

Even though the landing gear was clearly not working properly, the pilot was able to land the plane safely as the country watched live.

15. The 2000 Presidential election.
The 2000 Presidential election was complete madness on election day. No network had a handle on the results coming in and CNN actually announced Al Gore as the winner before recanting the statement shortly afterward. Several networks reported different projected winners numerous times throughout the evening and nobody that was watching the live broadcasts had any idea who the real winner was until the following day.

16. Berlin Wall is no more.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174294.jpg">

19. Man on the moon.
600 million people watched live on July 20, 1969 as the United States put the first ever person on the moon. Neil Armstrong became famous when he told the world, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." When you hear shows that broadcast live talk about their high number of viewers remember that number. 600 million. That's simply amazing.

21. Hurricane Katrina.
Today's weather forecasters can predict the landfall of a hurricane a week or so before it actually happens. This gives networks plenty of time to set up and capture the upcoming devastation. The Weather Channel broadcast the storm as it happened live and continued to do so several days after it hit. It brought the world the catastrophic events live.

22. O.J.'s slow car chase.
Before the world watched O.J. Simpson getting away with murder on live television, they watched live as he led police on a slow car chase when they were trying to take him into custody. The live coverage of the event consumed the nation as everything seemed to come to a halt so the world could watch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85174298.jpg">

23. 9/11.
