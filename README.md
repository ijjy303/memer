## <a href="#link5" id="link4">10 Children's Toys That Got Banned From Sale</a>
1. Sky Dancers - The little wind-up and spin through the air fairies were everywhere in the 90s and they were wreaking havoc. The Consumer Product Saftey Commission in 2000 stated when recalling the toy, "Galoob has received 170 reports of the dolls striking children and adults resulting in 150 reports of injuries. They include eye injuries, including scratched corneas and incidents of temporary blindness, broken teeth, a mild concussion, a broken rib, and facial lacerations that required stitches."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414615.jpg">

2. Yo-Yo Water Ball - Illinois, New Jersey and New York have all at one time or another banned Yo-Yo Water Balls, not only from stretch strings that wrap around kid's necks but also because the ball itself is made of flammable diesel hydrocarbons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414616.jpg">

3. Vibrating Nimbus 2000 Broom - This toy was quickly pulled from the market for obvious reasons....
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414617.jpg">

4. Moon Shoes - The little babies that were popular in the late 70s up until the 90s were everywhere and at least one friend you had got injured on them. These little trampolines for your feet could cause a broken or twisted ankle in the blink of an eye.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414618.jpg">

5. Cabbage Patch Snacktime Kids - These creepy little bastards were supposed to eat pre-packaged plastic food that comes with it. However, it would eat ANYTHING that got close to its close little mouth, which made it ideal for hair pulling fiascos and emergency room visits,
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414619.jpg">

6. The Breast Milk Baby - This baby doll that was introduced in Spain caused outrage among parents, thinking that the doll sexualized young girls, allowing them to "breast feed" the creepy doll.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414620.jpg">

7. SI: Fingerprint Examination Kit and CSI: Investigation Forensics Lab Kit - This seemed like an alright idea at the time, but what parents didn't know that the finger print powder that came with this popular 2007 board game was chalked FULL of asbestos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414621.jpg">

8. Black Canary Barbie - Who ever thought up the idea for this spin on Barbie, definitely likes the occasional spanking. The Black Canary Barbie was marketed as a super hero, but parents were right to see it as nothing more than S&M Barbie.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414622.jpg">

9. Caylee Sunshine Doll - Someone actually made a doll from Casey Anthony's dead daughter's likeness, naming it a Caylee Sunshine doll. No wonder it sparked such outrage and was pulled almost immediately
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2416556/85414623.jpg">

10. African American Oreo Barbie - Being quickly released and taken off the shelves in 1990, whoever thought up Oreo Barbie must've not realized that Oreo is a derogatory term for African Americans. They were probably not working at Mattel long after this.

## <a href="#link6" id="link5">20 Greatest Historic Falls from Grace</a>
1. Joe Paterno. He basically ran State College and 100% could’ve and should’ve done more after his reporting went nowhere. Instead, he chose to not make more noise and let it go. -c-williams88
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112614/87309169/paterno.jpg">

2. Benedict Arnold. Hero general of the American Revolution. One of George Washington's best assets. Felt slighted and overlooked by his contemporaries.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112511/87309155/benarn.jpg">

3. Fred Phelps. Started his career as a celebrated civil rights lawyer in Kansas. Followed up Brown vs Board of Education 20 years later and ended up forcing them to implement more fair educational conditions for students of color.

4. Bernie Madoff. His entire family thought he was some rich finance guy.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112601/87309166/mary1.jpg">

5. Mary I of England came to my mind first. Overcame huge threats & obstacles to her right to the throne … because she had the support and love of the people. She defeated the attempted coup, ascended to the throne, showed mercy to the traitors, etc.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112529/87309160/hansie.jpg">

Then promptly married an unpopular foreigner and tried to force everyone to follow her religion. If they didn’t, they got burned alive. -Adjectivenounnumb

7. Fritz Haber. A German Chemist and Nobel prize winner, he helped pioneer the Haber process for synthesizing Ammonia. This is important, because it was a key ingredient in artificial fertiliser. He has saved countless lives from hunger. Untold millions. Unlocking a piece of science that changed the face of organic chemistry forever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112544/87309163/henry8.jpg">

Then came the first world war. If he were a sorcerer, it would be as if he turned to the darkest of arts. After saving the world, and gifting such an innovation to humanity, he then turned his mind to destroying it. He invented chemical warfare. -Dawningrider
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112546/87309164/lindbergh.jpg">

8. Jeffrey Jones. In 2002, Jones was arrested for possession of child pornography and accused by a 17-year-old boy of solicitation to pose for nude photographs. He pleaded no contest to a charge of soliciting a minor, as the accuser was 14 when the offense first occurred. -MaeToMontreal

9. Aaron Burr. He was Vice President of the United States when he shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. The duel killed Burr's political career—he was dropped from Thomas Jefferson's ticket in the 1804 election, and he couldn't even win an election for governor of New York. -gerhudire
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112616/87309171/rudy.jpg">

10. Henry VIII has to be up there. He was a famously handsome, pious, and noble young king, very in love with Katherine when they were married, and over time he became the wife-killing tyrant we know today. -SmunkTheLesser
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112603/87309167/philspector.jpg">

11. Charles Lindbergh deserves to be in the conversation. After making the historic first solo transatlantic flight, and gaining the sympathy of many after the kidnapping and murder of his son, he promoted American neutrality in WWII. Though he reversed his stance after the attack on Pearl Harbor, many had already branded him a Nazi sympathizer. -itto_02
