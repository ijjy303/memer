## <a href="#link5" id="link4">30 Real Facts That Sound Fake</a>
1. An infinite supply of food would not solve world hunger. We actually have more than enough food to end world hunger, the issue is with distribution/logistics.

2. The shortest commercial flight in the world lasted 57 seconds. It was a Loganair flight between two Scottish islands, Westray and Papa Westray. It was recorded as the shortest commercial flight, with the distance of 1.7 miles.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87298312.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87298313.jpg">

10. Platypus glow under backlights.

19. "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" marks the one and only time that Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny have ever officially appeared in the same place at the same time, as well as Daffy and Donald.

Now the rope must be lengthened so that there is a one foot gape between the ball and the rope at all points, as if the rope is hovering a foot away around the entirety of the ball.

We have the same goal for the one foot hovering gap around the entirety of the earth. How far must the rope be lengthened? 6.28 Feet. This is so counter intuitive just about no one will believe it until shown the math.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87298324.jpg">
