## <a href="#link3" id="link2">This 90 Year Old Mural Appears To Show A Native American With A Smart Phone</a>
1.  The painting is titled, 'Mr. Pynchon and the Settling of Springfield' and was painted in the 1930's by Italian artist, Umberto Romano. The painting depicts Mr. William Pynchon, a successful fur trader, and founder Springfield Massachusetts. Mr. Pynchon was born in 1590 and is seen above, surrounded by Native Americans. Only there is one man in the image who appears to be holding something a little out of the ordinary for the time this piece is set in. It appears to be a Native holding, yes, a cell phone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85447372.jpg">

2. A zoomed look shows that whatever this native is holding, does strongly resembled an iPhone, though the iPhone wasn't invented until hundreds of years later. SO what could it have been? Because it sure isn't . . . .

## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Tragic Overdose Stories That Will Put You On The Straight And Narrow</a>
1. This viral video has left viewers divided across the Internet. Brenden Bickerstaff-Clark, 29, of Youngstown, Ohio, posted it in early October 2016 and it already has over 32 million views.

In the video, Bickerstaff-Clark is seen sitting across from his son. He holds the boy's hand and says, “Mommy died last night.” His son responds, “What?” The father confirms her death and shares that drugs caused the woman, who was not named, to die.

Bickerstaff-Clark said he recorded the moment for every addict with children. “Don't let this disease have to make someone tell your child that your dead because of drugs. This was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. My son has no mother because of heroin... kinda hard to hear but u can hear what we're saying. Please get help so our children don't have to suffer. This wasnt [sic] staged. This was real. I had someone record this so addicts with children can see the seriousness [sic] of our epidemic. I am a recovering addict myself with 94 days clean today... please share n maybe help save a childs [sic] parents life.”

2. Kelly-Mae Hemphill, 25, made headlines in February 2016 when she OD'd on a roadside in New Jersey and was brought back to life with the help of first responders. She later took to Facebook to defend her drug use saying, "Listen you stupid my daughter my daughter doesn't see t in person cuz I'm not like that when I'm around her," Hemphill wrote on Facebook. "Yes, she does not live with me so she does not see me high and you don't know what I've been through so unless you can walk in my shoes... I think you should just keep your f******* mouth shut."

Hemphill has since been busted on a bench warrant charge and had crack cocaine in her possession at the time of her arrest.

3. Two adults were found dead of a suspected overdose after their 7-year-old daughter told school officials in Pennsylvania she couldn't wake them up.

The bodies of Christopher Dilly, 26, and Jessica Lally, 25, were found in October 2016 in their McKeesport apartment. A 9-month-old girl, 3-year-old boy and 5-year-old boy who were inside the home were taken to a hospital to be evaluated and will likely stay with relatives.

4. Almost 40 "zombie" New Yorkers were seen struggling with the effects of a synthetic marijuana known as K2 in a viral video posted to YouTube in July 2016. 

K2 is sold for as little as $1 a hit, and the problem in Brooklyn all stems from one place — Big Boy Deli near Broadway and Myrtle Avenue. Locals said the deli is a frequent target of police raids. K2 contains man-made chemicals that act on the same cell receptors in the brain that THC does.

5. The Lawrence Police Department in Lawrence, MA released video footage of a two-year-old dressed in pink pajamas wailing while standing in the toy aisle of a Family Dollar store as she tried to wake her mother, who was sprawled across the floor after an apparent drug overdose. The department took possession of the video from a witness and decided to release it to raise awareness about the opioid epidemic.

The unidentified woman, a 36-year-old from New Hampshire, was transported to a local hospital. Police alerted the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, and the child has since been taken into protective custody.

6. In October 2016, video of a Tennessee couple lying on the sidewalk unconscious from a suspected heroin overdose went viral. Police said the couple snorted heroin in a nearby Walgreens bathroom and began to have strange reactions once outside. They were both taken to the hospital and revived. The woman, Carla Hiers, had a warrant out for her arrest and was arrested. She was held on $200 bond for offenses including leaving the scene of an accident and theft.

7. A photo capturing an Alabama officer comforting a 1-month-old baby girl after her parents overdosed went viral in October 2016. 

When officers arrived at the Birmingham apartment of the victims, they discovered a 30-year-old man dead on the kitchen floor and a 35-year-old woman unresponsive on the couch. Four children — ages 7, 3, 2, and 1-month — were left alone and frightened. Rescuers were able to revive the mother, and she was taken to the hospital.

The moment where one of the officers, Michelle Burton, was cradling the baby was captured in a photo. Her husband, Brian, posted it on Facebook with the caption, “Last night, my wife Michelle Burton told me she would be late getting off work because of a call she was on where the parents of 4 small children had both overdosed. Michelle said the father was dead and the mother was critical. She spent the rest of the night taking care of these babies. She got home at 4 this morning. I've never seen her more beautiful than in this picture. What an incredible woman.”

8. A grandmother who became infamous after police posted a photo of her and a friend passed out in their SUV from an apparent heroin overdose — while her 4-year-old grandson sat in the back seat — has been sentenced to 180 days in jail.

Rhonda Pasek, 50, pleaded no contest to charges of endangering a child, public intoxication, and a seat belt violation. It was the latest setback for Pasek, who lives in West Virginia, across the Ohio River from East Liverpool. According to her sister, she has struggled with substance abuse addiction for many years. The man in the car, James Acord, was sentenced to 360 days in jail and also pleaded no contest to child endangering charges. He was also fined $475 and got his driver's license suspended for 3 years.

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">Couple Finds Hidden Treasure In New House</a>
1. While moving all their stuff into their new house, Matt stacked some boxes into an empty closet, not paying much attention to the floor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089448.jpg">

2. While Matt was pretty oblivious to the secret hiding under the cardboard boxes, his wife noticed a panel in the floor and said to him, "Did you know we had a trapdoor?"
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089449.jpg">

3. Super curious, they quickly moved the boxes out of the way and Matt tried the handle...hoping not to find any dead bodies below.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089450.jpg">

4. The trapdoor opened easy but it looked like there was nothing but dust to be found down there.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089454.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089455.jpg">

9. It was surprisingly heavy.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089456.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089457.jpg">

11. Here's a close-up of the keyhole.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089458.jpg">

12. After finding out his locksmith friend wasn't coming to explore the unopened box, overly curious Matt decided he had to try to force it open and see what was hiding inside. He grabbed his tools and got to work!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089459.jpg">

13. Using a screwdriver and a hammer, Matt got the box open in no time at all.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089461.jpg">

16. This probably explains why the thing was so heavy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089462.jpg">

17. Here's a close-up of some of the coins, including a British 50 pence coin.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089467.jpg">

22. While looking through the coins, Matt's wife spotted something else...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85089468.jpg">

23. It was this awesome retro Silver Surfer card in a protective case.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/02/08/041520/85261676/1.jpg">

24. While the coins and card were cool, there was something else in there...
