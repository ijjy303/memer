## <a href="#link5" id="link4">19 People Who Used the Dark Web Reveal What They Saw</a>
1. "To bypass the censors in a country I was visiting, then I realized VPN is faster."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224735.jpg">

2. "About 10 years ago a friend of mine used it to buy 4 grams of cocaine. Cost him about 5 Bitcoins. Bitcoins were worth about $50 at the time."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224736.jpg">

3. "To download Internet explorer again."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224737.jpg">

4. "Every-once in a while I like to browse the dark market places for entertainment. They offer everything from drugs in small or massive quantities, firearms, fake documents, pirated software. I would never and have never actually bought anything, I just find it weirdly interesting, but it's really time consuming to find the right URL, make and account, etc. so its not something I do often."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224738.jpg">

5. "Looking up the text of statutes which, as a deeply law-abiding person, I would never violate."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224739.jpg">

6. "There are some other interesting things on these market places. It's not all super dark. But I did see human skulls for sale. But there are legal ways to buy those too."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224740.jpg">

7. "I watched a friend of mine make a drug purchase. There are market place onion sites for such things. Idk if this is overkill, but he uses a VPN. And he purchases from a "secure" Linux distro running on a virtual machine. Ofc in the end you always have to give your address to a stranger. The exchange is done with a handshake involving asymmetric encryption. The market place tries to mitigate FBI bait with user reviews. He tries to buy from the same sellers each time if he can. Still feels risky to me, but it's definitely still alive."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224741.jpg">

8. "I looked at the dark web. Found what was probrably a fake sales website but a very real website talking about selling illegal guns and the same thing with drugs. Again, probs not real but thats what I saw."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224742.jpg">

9. "Raw Opium from Pakistan a few years back. Grapefruit size ball for ~$50. Came in a tagine pot."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224743.jpg">

10. "To watch dark youtube, the sick and twisted version of youtube where smosh is still #1."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224745.jpg">

11. "I used TOR once because I thought maybe mushrooms would help my depression and that seemed like maybe a much better option vs trying to find them locally. 3/4 of the links on the hidden wiki were dead and those that weren't, looked like they were going to infect my PC/Network the second I clicked on anything."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224746.jpg">

12. "I recently installed a dark web in the trunk of my car. Helps immensely with the groceries, stops them from shifting around as I drive home. Although Amazon called it a "cargo net" for some reason, dunno why."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224747.jpg">

13. "I used to buy acid. I have no issue talking about it as it was about 8 years ago. Haven't used the dark web since."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224748.jpg">

14. "To rebroadcast baseball games without the express written consent of the Commissioner of Major League Baseball."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224749.jpg">

15. "To find out if somebody is selling my company’s or its employees information there. I work in cyber security."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224750.jpg">

16. "The dark web is just filled with scam or bait drug sites by the FBI, it's pretty boring honestly."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224751.jpg">

17. "To watch specific YouTube videos about how to fix a door hinge or how to stop a smoke alarm from beeping or whatever, without the algorithm thinking I'm just super into door hinges and smoke alarms forever."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224752.jpg">

18. "Part of my job! I am a Solutions Engineer for a Cyber Threat Intelligence service provider so I spend a good amount of time doing manual threat hunting in a lot of common dark web sources using Kali Linux VM and a lot of other tools besides TOR for looking up things like compromised credentials, data leakage, IOA (Indicators of Attack), chatter and even getting into IRCs and other covert communication platforms. I also do basic red-teaming tasks like open port scanning (NMAPing), vuln exploit correlation investigation, general attack surface assessments, etc."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224753.jpg">

19. "The only place where you can buy quality bat meat."
