## <a href="#link3" id="link2">25 Things People Are Boycotting & You Should Too</a>
1. "Stubhub— the way they handled the pandemic with changing their policies in peak pandemic so people could only recover credit or resell their tickets instead of receiving cash for canceled events was ridiculous. I was forced to hold my Coachella ticket for 2 years, then they decided to refund everyone this year when they realized they would make more money since the ticket prices will surge when the event is back in 2023. Fuck stubhub." - shughes330
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224978.jpg">

2. "Shaw Academy. Sleazy little fucks. Their lies in advertising, and nearly impossible to cancel a subscription with them. Tried doing a course that was "a free 4-week course". The course was free for the first 4 weeks but the way they sold it was that the course itself was 4 weeks and free. They say you can finish a course as fast or long as you want, but I think it caps out at 3 lessons a week making you stay in the program for a few months, paying monthly.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224979.jpg">

Trying to cancel is a nightmare. Sifting through pages and pages of "are you sure you want to cancel", "here's a 5% discount", "fill this form out, now this one, and now this one". All to get to a phone number that is only valid to call for a couple hours a day. When you finally get to call.. it's an automated message. 10 minutes of a robot telling me it cares about me and wants me to stay. Only to FINALLY press 2 to cancel my subscription. Fuck. Shaw Academy." - AdoptedMexican

3. "EBay. Escaped an abusive relationship, and was changing all my passwords to random combinations. Set it to log out all devices and force the password to be re-entered. It wasn't actually doing that. (I tried from multiple devices so it wasn't a keylogger or anything my abusive ex was doing. I also confirmed if I logged in on other devices, reset password and clicked to log out all devices it was not logging other devices out). Abusive ex was bidding/winning auctions. I called ebay to report the issue. They said it isn't that my account has been hacked/fraud because I know who is doing it. They would do NOTHING. Said I would just have to take the bad feedback and be blacklisted and that I should pick better partners. Didn't matter that they had a major security flaw. All I could do was remove the payment methods from my account so he couldn't pay for his auctions. I will never use them again." - TribalMog
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224981.jpg">

4. "Expedia and all the sites they own/control. Which is a LOT of them. Expedia screwed me over in a bad way, and then their Customer Service people insulted me when I tried to call attention to the serious issues. Ultimately, they offered me a gift card as a Take It or Leave It solution to the entire issue. I left it, and went on a crusade to slam them on Twitter. I did it for a long time but got bored." - Darth_Corleone

7. "Susan G. Koman Foundation - they employ alphabet soup & lawyer speak to defraud millions. NOTE: THEY DO NOT FUND RESEARCH NOR DO THEY HELP PATIENTS! THEY ARE AN ADVERTISING COMPANY. THEY ADVERTISE CANCER AWARENESS (because someone may be unaware of cancer \s)" - msmame

8. "Harvey Norman. They have terrible customer service and they took a whole lot of Australian government money that they didn’t deserve and are refusing to give it back." - 2exp77232917-1

9. "Comcast" - adogsgotcharacter

10. "FedEx - as much as I can help it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224988.jpg">

I obviously can't boycott them if it's the only delivery option on an e-commerce website, or if someone/company happens to ship me something via FedEx.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224989.jpg">

But I have literally chosen to pay more on an e-commerce website, to specifically not use FedEx as a shipping service.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224990.jpg">

Reason: When I bought my Pixel 3, the first day it was supposed to arrive, I worked from home that day to sign for my package. They never arrived, and on the tracking, wrote that I wasn't home to receive the package.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224991.jpg">

I was furious, so I spent the next two days working from home, and even did my work in the kitchen, so that I could physically see if any delivery driver actually walks up to my door. 3 straight fucking days in a row, not a single person comes up. Ring doorbell even doesn't show them walking up, but they have THE MOTHER FUCKING AUDACITY to claim I wasn't home 3 straight days in a row.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224992.jpg">

I ended up having to pick it up at their facility. Just because they LIED 3 times in a row, even after a phone call each day the first two days, the customer service person even told me I probably missed them when I went to the restroom or something -_- Can't even own up to the fucking fact that everybody in their company are a bunch of fucking liars.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87224993.jpg">

So for that reason alone, I pay more for shipping as long as it's not FedEx. I've specifically driven a further distance to get something printed at Staples or Office Depot just so I don't step foot into a FedEx store.

14. "State Farm. Thanks to some whistleblowers, they got busted committing fraud against their customers and the federal government after Hurricane Katrina. They told their claims adjusters to classify damage as flood damage, rather than wind damage, so that they could reject the claim and tell customers to file a federal flood insurance claim." - hells_cowbells

15. "Multi-level-marketing schemes. They’re shit companies that attract shitty, and sometimes desperate people, and train them on how to profit off of their friends and families. They destroy lives and I refuse to support them." - ClearBlue_Grace
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225000.jpg">

16. "Lifetime Fitness. It really pains me to write this, because I really love their gyms. I had a membership at Lifetime on and off through college. I went to a very large university with great amenities, so I didn’t need the membership during the school year. I tried to cancel at the end of one summer. I was at the gym one day and I asked about the cancellation. I was told to come back at a certain time frame the following Wednesday to cancel. I complied. When I showed up the “person doing the cancellations wasn’t there.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2588334/87225001.jpg">

I was told to return the following Wednesday. Surprise, surprise, the person wasn’t there again. I told them I was going to stop the payment through the credit card company. They responded by telling me that they’d take me to collections then. I ended up escalating through their corporate offices to get the membership canceled. They managed to get 2 extra months of fees out of me. After that year of college, I shifted over to LA Fitness and maintained that membership for about 10 years. When I moved away from LA Fitness, I joined the YMCA, where I’ve been for the last 5-6 years. I will always have a gym membership, but I am committed to not joining Lifetime Fitness again until am reimbursed. It’s really a loss for both of us." - IGuessIamYouThen

## <a href="#link5" id="link4">12 Pics That Will Make Your Emotions Peak</a>
1. Couple carries baby without brain to term, in order to donate organs.

In December, my wife Keri and I went in for the standard 19-week anatomy scan of our second child. As a parent, you think that appointment is all about finding out boy or girl, but it’s about a whole lot more. In our case, our daughter was diagnosed with a rare birth defect called anencephaly. Some three in 10,000 pregnancies rare. Congratulations to us. The phrase our doctor used in explaining it was “incompatible with life,” which looks as terrible in words as it sounds. The child fails to develop the frontal lobe of the brain, or the top of their skull. The chance of survival is literal zero percent. If you’re Googling it now — first of all, don’t click images — and see a story about a baby that has lived a lengthy time with anencephaly, either the baby doesn’t actually have anencephaly, or it’s being kept alive with every life support function possible. So we sat in a doctor’s office, five months before our daughter was set to be born, knowing she would die.

4. A 31-year-old San Antonio man, Anthony Garay, was arrested Wednesday after a relative was allegedly caught at school searching for pornography so that she could learn about what he was doing to her at night

The abuse came to light on May 16, when a teacher at Elm Creek Elementary caught one of the victims searching for pornography on a school-issued iPad, according to documents.
When the teacher asked the girl why she was searching for pornography, the child told her that she was searching for what was being done to her at night. She said Garay sexually assaults her “all the time at night” and never lets her sleep.
The teacher contacted Child Protective Services, and an investigator was sent to the school to interview the child. The girl told the investigator that Garay had sexually abused her from at least the age of 8, and that the abuse occurred in her home

6. A woman dying of cancer wrote her own obituary.

My obituary:
My name is Sonia Todd and I died of cancer at the age of 38. I decided to write my own obituary because they are usually written in a couple of different ways that I just don’t care for. Either family or friends gather together, and list every minor accomplishment from cradle to grave in a timeline format, or they try to create one poetic last stanza about someone’s life that is so glowing one would think the deceased had been the living embodiment of a deity.
I don’t like the timeline format because, let’s face it, I never really accomplished anything of note. Other than giving birth to my two wonderful, lovable, witty and amazing sons (James and Jason), marrying my gracious, understanding and precious husband (Brian), and accepting the Lord Jesus Christ as my personal savior – I have done very little. None of that requires obit space that I have to shell out money for.
I also didn’t want a bunch of my friends sitting around writing a glowing report of me that we all know would be filled with fish tales, half-truths, impossible scenarios, and outright honest-to-goodness lies. I just don’t like to put people in that kind of situation.
The truth, or my version of it, is this: I just tried to do the best I could. Sometimes I succeeded, most of the time I failed, but I tried. For all of my crazy comments, jokes, and complaints, I really did love people. The only thing that separates me from anyone else is the type of sin each of us participated in. I didn’t always do the right thing or say the right thing and when you come to the end of your life those are the things you really regret, the small simple things that hurt other people.
My life was not perfect and I encountered many, many bumps in the road. I would totally scrap the years of my life from age 16 to 20 … OK, maybe 14 to 22. I think that would eradicate most of my fashion disasters and hair missteps from the ’80s. But mostly, I enjoyed life. Some parts of it were harder than others but I learned something from every bad situation and I couldn’t do any more than that.
Besides there are some benefits to dying youngish. For example, I still owe on my student loans and the joke’s on them cuz I’m not paying them. Plus, I am no longer afraid of serial killers, telemarketers, or the IRS. I don’t have to worry about wrinkles or the ozone layer and/or hide from the news during election season.
Some folks told me that writing my own obituary was morbid, but I think it is great because I get a chance to say “thank you” to all the people who helped me along the way. Those that loved me, assisted me, cared for me, laughed with me, and taught me things so that I could have a wonderful, happy life. I was blessed beyond measure by knowing all of you. That is what made my life worthwhile.
If you think of me, and would like to do something in honor of my memory, do this:
Volunteer at a school, church, or library.
Write a letter to someone and tell them how they have had a positive impact on your life.
If you smoke – quit.
If you drink and drive – stop.
Turn off the electronics and take a kid out for ice cream and talk to them about their hopes and dreams.
Forgive someone who doesn’t deserve it.
Stop at all lemonade stands run by kids and brag about their product.
Make someone smile today if it is in your power to do so.

Photo shows Corporal Yukio Araki (age 17 years old) holding a puppy with four other young men (age 18 and 19 years old) of the 72nd Shinbu Corps. An Asahi Shimbun cameraman took this photo on the day before the departure of the 72nd Shinbu Corps from Bansei Air Base for their kamikaze mission in Okinawa.
Yukio Araki became the youngest kamikaze pilot during the Second World War when, at the age of seventeen, he took off from the Bansei Airfield, Kagoshima in a Tachikawa Ki-54 twin-engine training aircraft on 27 May 1945. It has been speculated that his plane was one of two that struck the destroyer USS Braine (DD-630), killing 66 of its crew; however, the ship did not sink. Araki had been home in April 1945, and left letters for his family, to be opened upon the news of his death. The letter to his parents noted: “Please find pleasure in your desire for my loyalty to the Emperor and devotion to parents. I have no regrets. I just go forward on my path”.
Ceremonies were carried out before kamikaze pilots departed on their final mission. The Kamikaze shared ceremonial cups of sake or water known as “mizu no sakazuki”. Many Army officer Kamikaze took their swords with them, while the Navy pilots (as a general rule) did not carry swords in their planes. The kamikaze, like all Japanese aviators flying over unfriendly territory, were issued (or purchased, if they were officers) a Nambu pistol with which to end their lives if they risked being captured. Like all Army and Navy servicemen, the Kamikaze would wear their senninbari, a “belt of a thousand stitches” given to them by their mothers. They also composed and read a death poem, a tradition stemming from the samurai, who did it before committing seppuku. Pilots carried prayers from their families and were given military decorations. The Kamikaze were escorted by other pilots whose function was to protect the Kamikaze to their destination and report on the results.
