## <a href="#link7" id="link6">Mom Who Was Shamed For Breastfeeding by a Cop Gets a Reply From The Sheriff</a>
1. His argument was founded on his claim that he could see a little areola.

From there things escalated rather quickly — he actually threatened to arrest her and then shamed her into finishing the feeding in her car.
She was so upset, she took to Facebook to post about the incident where it's been shared almost 15,000 times.

6. And one had the suggestion to contact the Sheriff via Facebook

7. She did just that, and Muscogee Country Sheriff Darr posted his response to her on Facebook as well.

8. Sheriff John T. Darr
September 26 at 8:11am ·

Good Morning,

I have seen and am aware of a post circulating Facebook, regarding a situation between a Muscogee County deputy and a woman attempting to breastfeed her young child. My wife and I have four children, each of whom were breastfed, and two of my daughters now have small children of their own. Therefore, I fully understand and appreciate the right of a woman to feed her child wherever she is most comfortable. It is also the law in the state of Georgia. We are currently looking into this incident and it will be addressed. Our office does not condone these actions and will ensure all officers know and understand the law. On behalf of the Muscogee County Sheriff's Office, I would like to personally extend an apology to the woman involved, and we hope that she knows that these are not the opinions or practices of the office as a whole.

9. Sam Taylor Sheriff, this went viral, and your response is wonderful. As a public servant myself, I salute you.

Roxanne Lenae Phillips That's the problem now days the cops are not properly trained on the laws or how to handle situations. Women should be able to feed their babies anywhere without any shame. If it was your screaming baby hungry you would want him/her feed. But cops can make mistakes and its no big deal but we citizens make a mistake or drive 5 over the speed limit or silly things we have to pay for them.

Simon Boterkooper Dus het klopt wat je ziet in elke Amerikaanse tv series. Jullie zijn zo bang voor tepels dat vrouwen tijdens de sex hun bh aanhouden. En maar klagen over moslima's met een hoofddoek. Trieste mensen daar aan de andere kant van de plas.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">17 Backstories To Why Actors And Actresses Were Written Out Of TV Shows</a>
1. Billy the Blue Ranger (David Yost) wasn’t fired from The Power Rangers, but he randomly walked off the set during his lunch break one day and never came back. Turns out, the crew had been harassing him for years about his sexual orientation and he’d been contemplating suicide. After he left the show, he put himself in conversion therapy for two years, then finally accepted his sexual orientation after a psychological breakdown.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830123.jpg">

2. They told us Steve from Blues Clues left to go to college. He really left because the actor was going bald. (He also had some musical interests he wanted to explore, but the actor said, “Mostly because I refused to lose my hair on a kid’s TV show, and it was happening fast.”)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830124.jpg">

3. Tommy Chong left “That 70’s Show” because he went to jail for 9 months for selling bongs. In jail he was cell mates with Jordan Belfort (as portrayed by Leo DiCaprio in “Wolf of Wall Street”), and Chong was one of the major influences convincing Jordan to write his book.Tommy Chong would later reprise his role as Leo on “That 70’s Show” after getting out of jail.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830125.jpg">

4. William Hartnell left Doctor Who because he had arteriosclerosis and his health was declining to the point where he couldn’t keep up with a TV acting schedule. The producers came up with the idea that the Doctor could regenerate into a new body, because the show was doing well and they wanted to keep it going. Hartnell was apparently the one who suggested Patrick Troughton should take over the role. So ultimately Hartnell’s illness inspired the premise gimmick that would make the show (and its hero) effectively immortal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830126.jpg">

5. Remember when Maude Flanders died via a volley from a t-shirt cannon brigade? Maggie Roswell, the voice actress for Maude, got into a payment dispute with the show — she lived out of state and had to pay for her own flight to LA and wanted a raise to compensate those expenses. The show found it cheaper to just kill her off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830127.png">

6. Kyra from the show Reba (Scarlett Pomers) left the show, with the full support of the cast, mid-season in 2005 to get treatment for anorexia. She was 5’2″ and weighs only 73 pounds.After completing treatment and getting her weight back up and life back together she returned to the show. She walks into the house and someone asks, “Hey, where have you been?” To which she replied, “I went to get something to eat!”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830128.jpg">

7. The original owner of the store on Sesame Street was a wonderful, kind old man named Mr Hooper. The actor who played him died, and rather than quietly write him out, Sesame Street had a whole show explaining he died.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830129.jpg">

8. On Cheers, Carla’s husband Eddy was written off because of some rude comments that the actor made. He had a national radio show at the time and made some jokes about Rhea Perlman’s looks and getting “combat pay” for kissing her. Perlman wanted him off the show, the show runners agreed and had him killed off by a zamboni.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830130.jpg">

9. Michael O’Hare, who played Jeffrey Sinclair in Babylon 5, left the show due to suffering from psychological issues (paranoia, hallucinations, etc). They wanted to put the show on hiatus while he sought treatment, but he insisted be written out so the show could go on without him while he got help. The shows creator agreed to keep his condition a secret till after O’Hare’s death (at his request).

10. Dominic Monaghan asked to be written out of Lost because he was seeing Evangeline Lily, but she dumped him and he couldn’t stand to work with her anymore.

11. Janet Hubert – The original Aunt Viv in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was fired from the show after violating her contract by getting pregnant. She wasn’t written off but she was replaced by Daphene Maxwell Reed in the last 3 seasons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830133.jpg">

12. Lisa Bonet was written off of the Cosby Show for ‘creative differences’, but in reality it was because she was in Angel Heart and had done a topless spread in a magazine. It didn’t fit with Cosby’s vision so she was fired.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830134.png">

13. Chef was killed off on South Park because the voice actor Isaac Haye, a Scientologist, had a problem with the fact that Parker and Stone lampooned Scientology in one episode.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830135.jpg">

14. One of the many reasons that Punky Brewster was cancelled is because the star of the show, Soleil Moon Frye suffered from a condition called gigantomastia, literally giant breasts, and had a breast reduction surgery prior to her 16th birthday to reduce her 38DD to a more manageable size. The actress developed so quickly and so large that the producers felt there was no way they could reasonably portray her character age-appropriately.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2386814/84830136.jpg">

15. When Family Matters first aired, it was a spin-off of the show Perfect Strangers, following Harriett Winslow and her husband Carl- a typical middle-class black family, having the kinds of difficulties that normal middle-class black families face. Then, a few episodes in, they introduce the nerdy, obnoxious neighbor Steve Urkel.Before long Urkel was such a hit that the show eventually became all about Steve and his wacky adventures. Gone was the down-to-earth show about a typical black family doing typical black family things, and in its place was a show about a man-boy genius creating wacky inventions and traveling through time, cloning himself, and having other crazy adventures. In the end, the woman that played Harriett (the entire reason the show existed, remember) quit because she couldn’t stand what the show had become.The youngest daughter in Family Matters, Jaimee Foxworth, apparently her parents were trying to get more money from the contract and when they refused to pay they just left the show. She eventually moved into the porn film industry.

16. Brenda from Beverly Hills: 90210 was written off the show because Shannen Doherty was being a demanding self-entitled bitch and got fired.Prue Halliwell was killed in Charmed because Shannen Doherty was fired for being a demanding self-entitled bitch and kept getting into arguments and having hissy fits about Alyssa Milano. You’d think the woman would have learned her lesson at some point.

17. Damon Wayans was allegedly fired from Saturday Night Live during the show (between the open and the goodnights) because, sick of playing underwritten side characters, he came out for a sketch and played his bit part as an extremely effeminate man without any prior indication that he would.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Owner Shares Last Day With Her Beloved Pup</a>
1. She had this to say:
“For about two months Hannah has been having seizures, they were small and nothing to worry about, but they gradually got worse. Hannah was on a couple of meds, one for her kidneys and another for the pain she had in her elbows and her hips.
When she wasn’t on her meds, she didn’t have really bad seizures, she had them, but they weren’t horrible, but when she wasn’t on her meds, she couldn’t walk well or make it up the stairs, several times she fell down them or up them.
I finally decided that keeping her on the meds was selfish, but keeping her off of them was just as cruel. So I decided to give her one last hoo-rah day of pampering, like the queen she’s always been, and let her go. Where there would be no pain, no seizures, no whimpering in the night. Just peace and hopefully love.❤ R.I.P. Hannah.“
