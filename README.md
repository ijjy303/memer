3. Robert F. Kennedy’s wife, Ethel, attempts to comfort him as lay mortally wounded on floor of the kitchen in the Ambassador Hotel. June 6, 1968.

“We judge the United States of America by [the size of our economy, when that number] . . . does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play; it does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything in short except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.”
-Robert F. Kennedy.

4. American soldier standing in the ruined Monument to the Battle of Nations in Leipzig, Germany, 1945.

A U.S. soldier stands in the middle of rubble in the Monument of the Battle of the Nations in Leipzig after they attacked the city on April 18, 1945. The huge monument commemorating the defeat of Napoleon in 1813 was one of the last strongholds in the city to surrender. One hundred and fifty SS fanatics with ammunition and foodstuffs stored in the structure to last three months dug themselves in and were determined to hold out as long as their supplies. American First Army artillery eventually blasted the SS troops into surrender.

5. Russian Imperial family – circa 1914.

When Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, George’s first cousin, was overthrown in the Russian Revolution of 1917, the British government offered political asylum to the Tsar and his family, but worsening conditions for the British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George to think that the presence of the Russian royals would be seen as inappropriate. Despite the later claims of Lord Mountbatten of Burma that Prime Minister Lloyd George was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of Lord Stamfordham suggest that it was George V who opposed the rescue against the advice of the government. The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were killed by Bolsheviks in 1918. King George V essentially signing his owns cousin’s death certificate.

7. Richard and Mildred Loving. The Supreme Court ruled interracial marriage bans unconstitutional in the case of Loving vs Virginia – June 12, 1967.

The Ruling:
Marriage is one of the “basic civil rights of man,” fundamental to our very existence and survival…. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State’s citizens of liberty without due process of law. The Fourteenth Amendment requires that the freedom of choice to marry not be restricted by invidious racial discrimination. Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the State.

According to Unsolved Mysteries, a day after the escape a man claiming to be John Anglin had called a lawyer in San Francisco and wanted the lawyer to arrange a meeting with the US Marshals’ Office. When the lawyer refused to do this, the person hung up. The sister of the brothers, Marie Anglin Widner, has told the media she believes that the brothers attented their mother’s funeral in 1973, disguised as women. On October 12, 2015, the History Channel premiered a documentary about the 1962 Alcatraz escape, focusing on John and Clarence Anglin and the possibility that their escape was successful. The program, Alcatraz: Search for the Truth provided viewers with evidence kept by the brothers’ family that included: Christmas cards signed by “John” and “Clarence”; an audio tape of a childhood family friend, Fred Brizzi, telling the family in the early 1990s about a chance encounter in 1975 with the brothers in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; a photograph taken by the same family friend in 1975 of two men resembling John and Clarence Anglin.

## <a href="#link11" id="link10">20 Celebrities Who Destroyed Their Own Careers</a>
1. Antonio Brown. Drove 100 down McKnight Road in Pittsburgh, which has a 45 MPH speed limit. Tried to fight Mike Mayock, called him a cracker, had to be held back by Vontaze Burfict, then punted a football down the practice field and said "fine me for that." The sexual assault allegations came out. Etc, etc... -reverend_fancypants

2. Bam Margera for me. He looks horrible now, like his dad but worse. Wouldn't be surprised if I wake up one morning and he's dead. -True_Egg_5685

3. John Belushi. In a brief period in the 1970s starred in 'SNL', 'Animal House',  and 'The Blues Brothers'. but died in 1982 from a heroin overdose. -c-fox

4. Brad Renfro. He died of a drug overdose at the age of 25 after a steep downward spiral. It is suspected he was the victim of Hollywood predator types when he was still a young boy, right after starring in "The Client" as his star was rapidly ascending. -igneousink

5. I know it’s a bit of a niche but… Conor McGregor. The Khabib fight was the biggest in his career. Two years of layoff, returning to face an unstoppable juggernaut. The press conferences were packed with vitriol and pure bile rather than the typical tongue in cheek charm. It was uncharacteristic - or rather, it was the mask coming off at last.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020153/87289834/conor.jpg">

He got humiliated badly, and everything went wild. Cocaine. Sexual assault scandals, whether true or not. Alcohol. He started his own whiskey brand. Apparently it’s garbage, but don’t take it from me. Take it from the old man he sucker punched in a bar for refusing to drink it. -DrJonesPHD62
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020157/87289835/cosby.jpg">

6. Bill Cosby. He was America's favorite Dad, stand up comic, had several very successful TV shows, spoke at colleges....then poof! He's just a dirty creepy guy who spikes your drink so he can get some. -Eponarose
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020135/87289828/amandabynes.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020158/87289836/jim.jpg">

8. Jim Morrison. The guy would show up drunk and absolutely wrecked all the time during recordings, got arrested on many occasions for his behavior, and later on dies literally right after coming from a bar in his own bathtub. It’s sad and I absolutely adore him as an artist but man is it sad to hear what he got himself into leading to his inevitable death. -TheBeanBagger

9. Johnny Manziel. He beeat Alabama, won the Heisman trophy, was on top of the college football world. Still got drafted in the first round despite trouble starting to mount in his final year at Texas A&M.

Struggled immensely on and off the field in Cleveland (domestic violence, disappearing to Vegas wearing a disguise, and much more), was out of the NFL after two seasons, and was dropped by nearly everyone in his circle. Popped back up in the CFL, then to the Alliance League, and now he’s a former Heisman Trophy winner/1st round NFL Draft pick playing in the Fan-Controlled Football League. -MIDNIGHT_KNIGHT

10. Amy Winehouse. Watching her destruction throughout 2007 and 2008 was just horrible, it was like a car crash that no one could stop. I’ve never been able to watch the footage of her final concert in Belgrade as she just looks terrified and with no control. -Btd030914

11. Jussie Smollett. I think his prime motivation was that fame wasn’t enough for him. He wanted to become a symbol, too. And what’s a more positive symbol than standing against racism?  -PenguinGunner
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020216/87289841/michaelrichards.jpg">

12. Lance Armstrong had an incredible fall from grace. From multiple Tour de France champion to steroid denier, and finally admitted everything but too late. Lost everything and he couldn't even get sympathy when he went through testicular cancer, that's how bad his spiral was. -jspockman
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020217/87289842/kurt.jpg">

13. Michael Richards comes to mind. Massive role as Kramer in one of the most popular TV sitcoms of all time, and then, yikes. Just no coming back from his stand-up meltdown. -Trillamanjaroh
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020221/87289843/mel.jpg">

14. Kurt Cobain. Formed Nirvana in '87, and went from playing record store gigs and dive bars in the late 80's to putting out Nevermind, a record that knocked Michael Jackson out of the #1 spot in Jan of '92. Back then, something like that was unheard of and considered impossible in the industry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/18/020151/87289833/chris.jpg">

For the next couple of years Nirvana were arguably one of the biggest and most popular rock bands in the world, but Cobain was already thinking of ways to essentially sabotage the bands popularity because he was so uncomfortable with how famous they got while dealing with his own inner demons and drug addiction. -DrRDuke

Guy went from being quite a beloved and pretty decent actor to a respected director, and then said some really hateful things about Jews in the back of a police car (among other things). -Jonnydodger

16. I think of Chris Farley. His SNL career started in '92(ish), his real break came with 'Tommy Boy' in '94. Dead by '98 at 33 years old. Horribly addicted to drugs, alcohol, food, and other impulse related stuff probably. Probably gained 100lbs in his 6 year run.
