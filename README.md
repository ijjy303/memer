<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060258.jpg">

4. Being a ceremonial guard might seem like a cool job, but standing motionless and expressionless for long hours in every kind of weather is actually not cool at all. Moreover, the guards often have to endure annoying tourists who take pictures with them.

5. Working for cosmetic companies, armpit sniffers are paid for smelling other people´s armpits to determine the effects of the companies´ products such as deodorants.

6. As disgusting as the previous job, the position of a breath odor evaluator also requires a good sense of smell and willingness to evaluate smells that are usually far from pleasant. Breath odor evaluators usually work for mint and toothpaste companies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060261.jpg">

7. The dog version of the breath odor evaluator, the dog breath sniffer analyzes odor of dog´s breath to test the effect of their diet on their teeth.

8. Another job that really stinks, a sewage cleaner has to deal with some of the worst odors on a daily basis. In some less developed countries, sewage cleaners even have to dive into the sewage and clean it manually.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060263.jpg">

9. Also known as morgue attendants or autopsy technicians, dieners are morgue workers responsible for handling, moving, and cleaning the corpses before autopsies are performed in hospitals.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060265.jpg">

11. In India, people can have their ears cleaned by a specialist known as an ear cleaner. First, the cleaner examines your ear with a brass pick, and then he removes all the ear wax.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060266.jpg">

12. If you wonder what a pusher actually pushes, let us inform you he pushes people in the train or metro in a station during the rush hours. This job is particularly common in Japan where the pushers are known as “oshiyas.”

13. Native to Sumatra, the corpse flower is a gigantic flowering plant notorious for its extremely strong odor similar to that of rotten flesh. While the odor is literally unbearable to most people, some botanists grow these plants in greenhouses.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060268.jpg">

14. Coal miners are known to have a considerably shorter life expectancy than other people as they work in an incredibly dusty, humid and hot environment that constantly damages their health. Moreover, there is also the risk of tunnel collapses and gas explosions.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060269.jpg">

15. A job for only the most hardened, a crime scene cleaner is responsible for making things nice again after homicides, suicides, accidents etc. As you might assume, performing this job includes removing blood stains, body parts, bodily fluids and other gory things.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060270.jpg">

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060271.jpg">

17. Yes, some pet food producers actually pay people to taste their products. As disgusting as it may sound, some pet foods are actually said to be quite tasty even for humans.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060272.jpg">

18. Similar to the paint drying watcher, the position of grass growing watcher also sounds extremely boring, but some grass seed houses really employ these people.

19. In places such as circuses and fairs, some “shooting” attractions require so called target boys or target girls. Whether the target is to be hit with an arrow, knife or gun, it is always an accident waiting to happen.

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060275.jpg">

21. Animal manure is often used as a fertilizer to help crops grow, but even this stuff needs to meet certain standards first. Therefore, the manure has to be collected and inspected by a manure inspector.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060277.jpg">

22. Unsurprisingly, a gravedigger is one of the least popular jobs, but this profession has been around for centuries, occurring in most cultures. In fact, even some celebrities have worked as gravediggers including former US President Abraham Lincoln and British singer Rod Stewart.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85060278.jpg">

23. One of the dirtiest jobs ever, a renderer engages in rendering, a process that converts animal waste tissue into stable, value-added materials. The smell and sights inside a rendering workplace are a way beyond bearable for most people.
