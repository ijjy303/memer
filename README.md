2. Posted to an all-girls forum, the woman said she found three jars, one with white liquid and clumps of her hair, another jar with honey, herbs and her full name scrawled across it, and a third with just honey and herbs. She pleaded for advice from anyone who claimed to understand what it was.

3. The first piece of advice was to RUN!

4. This should make for an awkward conversation...

5. Looks like this person has some experience with creeps.

6. There's an expert in every crowd.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">Dude Discovers A Hidden Dungeon Under His New Apartment</a>
1. So far I love the place, look at the high ceilings in the kitchen/living area.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398383.jpg">

2. In order to maximize the space in the cavernous building, they built a second level in his apartment.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398384.jpg">

3. Yep, that’s his bedroom. Wouldn’t want to even try sleeping off a night of drinking on that thing. I get the bed spins pretty bad, and it looks like if he falls out of bed, he dies.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398385.jpg">

4. The bathroom is decent; stand up shower, small sink… assume there’s a toilet.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398386.jpg">

5. Wait, there’s something on the floor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398387.jpg">

6. And that, urban explorers, in case you’re wondering, is the handle to a trapdoor.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398388.jpg">

7. Against better judgement, he opens it up. He says this wasn’t mentioned anywhere on the lease, or even when the place was shown to him prior to the rental.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398389.jpg">

8. At first glance, it looks like some underfloor storage for some old tools and paint. Seems pretty unexciting. It’s not as if it could be hiding anything more creepy or nefarious, right? It’s a small, cheap studio apartment in an old monastery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398390.jpg">

9. Except when you look at it from the bathroom, there’s a scary dark space that looks like it goes deeper.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398391.jpg">

10. Yep, those are stairs. Stairs that go down into a dark, stone-lined space below an old, medieval/Victorian building in England.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398392.jpg">

11. It’s a dungeon. An actual freaking dungeon below his place, that possibly spanned the footprint of the building. He wasn’t brave enough to do it alone, so he wedged his bathroom door over the closed hatch and called a friend.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398393.jpg">

12. Once the friend arrived, the headed downstairs. What they found was a proper 19th century layout of corridors, hatches and rooms underneath.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398394.jpg">

13. These are the scary stairs lead down into the dungeon. This is the only set of stairs that they found going down there, so thus far, he’s the only one that has access.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398395.jpg">

14. This space is underneath a neighbours apartment. It’s just an empty space full of bricks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398396.jpg">

15. More explorations.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398397.jpg">

16. Here it looks like the old, slatted subfloor is rotting away, and you can see the new subfloor above. So it’s not as if no one knew this space was here – the contractors must have been down there at some point.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398398.jpg">

17.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398399.jpg">

18. In one empty room, they found some graffiti. It looks relatively recent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398400.jpg">

19. It’s a pretty big space, with a lot of headroom. Demc7 says that it’s a little damp, but not horrible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398401.jpg">

20. In the far corner is this. Looks like a crypt. You can imagine a coffin/sarcophagus there for some sort of Victorian Memento Mori/Spiritualist seance.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85398402.jpg">

21. In the centre of the room he found a hole with recently disturbed soft dirt.It looks like something was buried down there. Something evil. Or not.
