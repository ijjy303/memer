## <a href="#link4" id="link3">Guy Makes An Amazing Flying Burger Commercial Without CGI Effects</a>
1. The technique is known as "burger drop" and can be made with computer effects...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224900.jpg">

2. ...but this was created without CGI.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224901.gif">

3. Miami photographer Steve Giralt spent a month creating PATRIC - Precision Arduino Timing Relay Imaging Controller that made it possible.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224902.jpg">

4. Creating the effect of burger shaping itself wasn't easy, but Giralt said he had to prove that it's posible without the computer effects that are everywhere these days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224903.jpg">

5. It took 10 tries to film the flying ingredients, only 4 of them forming a burger, but to hit it with mustard and ketchup was a challenge for 20 tries. Placing the beer without it spilling took 10 tries.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224904.jpg">

6. Steve said he did it for the challenge and the month was too long, he could've done it quicker but he had other assignments.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/718392/85224905.jpg">

7. A burning passion or too much free time? You decide.

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">People Share The Weirdest Things They've Seen  Over Someone's Shoulder</a>
1. 50 year old guy sitting on the train in front of me was shamelessly reading One Direction fanfiction. I say 'shamelessly' because it was open full screen on his computer and I'm pretty sure the font was even turned up to be bigger than default.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315616.jpg">

2. I once busted my little brother looking up "naked Pokemon, naked Pikachu" and "big titty black women". It's been almost 20 years. Every few years I'll give him some Pokémon related gift for his birthday with a "never forget" card attached
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315614.jpg">

3. My brother was a voracious user of the old AOL chatrooms. One day out of the blue in conversation with an AOL user from France, he started typing out the french language. I was amazed. Who knew that my brother could converse in french? He never had a french language lesson in his life, never spoke a word in french or any other foreign language, he never cracked open a book on anything, he had no french friends or acquaintances off line, etc. How he knew how to speak in french is a total mystery to me to this day. Never saw him do it again.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/04/05/112453/85316381/dsdd.jpg">

4. I found a guy searching for "old granny sex tape" on pornhub, later on I asked him why an old lady and he said:"all we see is youngs or milfs, I needed to change my sight".
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315618.jpg">

5. I saw someone going through the pictures on their phone showing something to someone next to them and needless to say, he forgot he had pictures of him balls deep in a girl (I also somewhat knew) and it scrolled by as he was skimming through the photos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2017/04/05/121102/85316442/Phoz.jpg">

6. Some 9th grade kids on my bus really like Hitomi Tanaka
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315622.jpg">

7. Saw one of my 29 year old coworkers looks at my little pony on his computer, wears a my little pony lanyard, has a my little pony sticker on his external hard drive and wears my little pony t-shirts.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315620.jpg">

8. looked over a guys shoulder on the bus he was searching through images of blue waffle, the only thing I could describe this guy as is fucked in the head mental shit
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315621.jpg">

9. They were probably suffering from short term amnesia. I sat next to a lady on a bus for a little over an hour. She repeatedly went back to a meme about Valentine's day and laughed at it. She then kept starting to forward it to friends, going back to her Facebook feed and scrolling through all the posts she had just read, arriving at the meme, reading it intently again, laughing, forwarding it to a friend... This went on for 45 minutes
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315615.jpg">

10. Found another furry looking at furry porn in class.Never talked to them.

11. I was on the bus and this guy in front of me was trying to sell 150 editions of Playboy on eBay on his phone. He looked a little sketchy...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/730195/85315624.jpg">

12. Was on a train once and the guy in front of me was googling "Lois Griffin naked big bum".

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">15 Times Actors and Actresses Were NOT Faking Their Sex Scenes </a>
1. In Little Ashes, Twilight star Robert Pattinson has a scene where he pleasures himself. Many people found his performance to be a little too convincing. Pattinson would later reveal he absolutely did the deed just below camera saying there was no way he could properly portray the scene without actually following through with the act.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191016.jpg">

2. In Lie With Me, Eric Balfour and Lauren Lee Smith made no qualms about their explicit, real sex and never even denied it. That would essentially make this a porn, no?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191017.jpg">

3. I am sure this comes as a huge shocker, but there are rumors that much of the sex in this film did in fact actually happen. The only participants to actually come clean, however, are Shia Labeouf and Stacy Martin. Martin has since back tracked and said it didn’t actually happen, but knowing Lars Von Trier, I tend to side with debauchery.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191018.jpg">

4. It was the wild 70’s, so this may be even less surprising than the last, but some of the sex and fellatio scenes in this movie really took place. Maybe most shocking is that the actors who participated, Helen Mirren and Malcolm McDowell, turned out to be highly respected actors. And Mirren is an absolute fox.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191019.jpg">

5. Here’s that Lars Von Trier guy again. Surprise surprise. His last movie on this list dealt with sexual addiction, while this one is more about relationships, but the result is still the same. Explicit and real sex. Copious amounts. All of the intercourse and masturbation is real, with the film’s producers saying, “Without the sex scenes, the film’s drama would fall apart.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191020.jpg">

6. The Brown Bunny has perhaps the most well-known non-simulated sex scene. In this film, Chloe Sevigny gives co-star and Director (wonder who did the casting for this?) oral sex all on camera. No body doubles. No trick dick. This is the real deal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191021.jpg">

7. Perhaps the most influential Blaxploitation film, is more regularly remembered for the very authentic and graphic sex scenes. Of course, they look real because they are. According to Melvin Van Peebles, he even got the STD to prove it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191022.jpg">

8. Director John Waters may be almost as famous as Von Trier for his propensity to push the envelope and stir controversy. In Pink Flamingos, over-the-top drag queen Divine gives completely authentic oral sex to her son… This comes after she eats dog shit. Must see?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191023.jpg">

9. Perhaps the only tandem to be more infamous than famous for their real sex scene, Kieran O’Brien and Margo Stilley admitted to really doing the duty, even after being voted one of the worst sex scenes of all time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191024.jpg">

10. Perhaps it’s not too surprising that the French, known to push the envelope artistically, would have a film make this list. Baise-moi is a film about rape-revenge featuring some brutal unsimulated sex.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191025.jpg">

11. Over four decades ago, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie engaged in one of the hottest damn sex scenes ever on film. For the day and age it was shot, it destroyed the boundaries of main stream Hollywood sex scenes. Since then, Christie has all but confirmed the rumors that their red hot on film action, was the real deal.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191026.jpg">

12. In the HBO series, Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer have some steamy as hell sex scenes. Many, including people on the sets have said they were definitely not faking it, but the couple have never confirmed. Ooooh Sookie Sookie!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191027.jpg">

13. All kinds of rumors came out about Sienna Miller’s smoking hot sex scene with Hayden Christensen in Factory Girl. Many people accused and claimed the scene was in fact real. Miller has denied it from day one, saying she’s just that good of an actress, but I think we all know that’s not true. I am going to choose to believe she’s a dirty dirty girl and got nasty on camera. For journalistic reasons.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191028.jpg">

14. On this track by The Notorious B.I.G. there is background noise that sounds a little too much like Biggie getting a hummer. Puff Daddy later confirmed in a interview that you’re hearing exactly what you think you are.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85191029.jpg">

15. In the video for Marilyn Manson’s Heart Shaped Glasses, the singer engages in some seriously convincing sex with then girlfriend Evan Rachel Wood. Neither star has confirmed it was the real deal, but Manson is on record saying Wood got paid the most money anyone ever has for appearing in a music video for a reason…
