## <a href="#link7" id="link6">This Woman Wore Nothing But Paint And Nobody Had a Clue</a>
1. She had body image issues stemming from a classmate’s careless comment about her thighs after Julie had performed in a leotard for a high school musical.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328939.jpg">

2. Meet Julie, who decided to do a little experiment — she would wear body paint for the entire day and see if anyone noticed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328925.jpg">

3. So she decided to exorcise those demons by having professional body painter Pashur House paint her in jeans and a white T-shirt.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328926.jpg">

6.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328941.jpg">

7. Okay, she had on underwear, but if she didn't have those on we wouldn't be able to show you these pictures, and trust me, you're going to want to see them and hear why it's about more than just walking around almost naked.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328928.jpg">

8. But the level of detail? Amazing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328929.jpg">

9. And the cuffs totally look 3-D.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328930.jpg">

10. But despite the awesome paint job, there were some definite concerns for Julie going into this whole thing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328931.jpg">

11. In fact, it was really emotional.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328932.jpg">

12. “You feel naked or you feel all these negative things about yourself that no one else sees,” she said. “And no one else understands.”
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328933.jpg">

13. But there's no crying when you're painted because, well, you don't want to wipe the paint off with your tears.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328934.jpg">

14. But despite the fact that the paint covered her body, it was still more like being naked.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328935.jpg">

15. As you can see, there’s not much difference between her skin and the paint, so from a distance, it tricks the eye, but Julie definitely felt exposed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328936.jpg">

16. So now it was time for the challenge — to head out into the real world
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328937.jpg">

17. And after she told them, they were equal parts amazed and then a little bit embarrassed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85328938.png">

18. But for Julie, it was really an emotional experience.
