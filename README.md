## <a href="#link3" id="link2">20 Greatest Historic Falls from Grace</a>
1. Joe Paterno. He basically ran State College and 100% could’ve and should’ve done more after his reporting went nowhere. Instead, he chose to not make more noise and let it go. -c-williams88
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112614/87309169/paterno.jpg">

2. Benedict Arnold. Hero general of the American Revolution. One of George Washington's best assets. Felt slighted and overlooked by his contemporaries. Switched sides to the British, made no difference to the war effort. Died in disgrace in England. His name is now a synonym for traitor. -GonnaGoFar
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112511/87309155/benarn.jpg">

3. Fred Phelps. Started his career as a celebrated civil rights lawyer in Kansas. Followed up Brown vs Board of Education 20 years later and ended up forcing them to implement more fair educational conditions for students of color.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112521/87309158/fredphelps.jpg">

Went on to form the Westboro Baptist Church which became one of the most despicable hate groups in the US. Notorious for their homophobia and protesting at military funerals. -MercutioMan
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112517/87309157/bernie.jpg">

4. Bernie Madoff. His entire family thought he was some rich finance guy. Then they find out not only do they have nothing, but their dad stole (and destroyed) more money than just about any individual in the history of the world. Bernie and his wife tried to commit suicide, and one of his sons was successful in doing so. -Radrezzz
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112601/87309166/mary1.jpg">

5. Mary I of England came to my mind first. Overcame huge threats & obstacles to her right to the throne … because she had the support and love of the people. She defeated the attempted coup, ascended to the throne, showed mercy to the traitors, etc.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112529/87309160/hansie.jpg">

Then promptly married an unpopular foreigner and tried to force everyone to follow her religion. If they didn’t, they got burned alive. -Adjectivenounnumb
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112528/87309159/fritzh.jpg">

6. Hansie Cronje. Post Apartheid cricket captain in South Africa. He united a divided nation through so many sports victories. In 2000 however, he was found guilty of match fixing.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112533/87309161/jeffreyjones.jpg">

He died mysteriously in a plane crash in 2002, soon after being exposed. -pensy
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112535/87309162/burr.jpg">

7. Fritz Haber. A German Chemist and Nobel prize winner, he helped pioneer the Haber process for synthesizing Ammonia. This is important, because it was a key ingredient in artificial fertiliser. He has saved countless lives from hunger. Untold millions. Unlocking a piece of science that changed the face of organic chemistry forever.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112544/87309163/henry8.jpg">

Then came the first world war. If he were a sorcerer, it would be as if he turned to the darkest of arts. After saving the world, and gifting such an innovation to humanity, he then turned his mind to destroying it. He invented chemical warfare. -Dawningrider
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112546/87309164/lindbergh.jpg">

8. Jeffrey Jones. In 2002, Jones was arrested for possession of child pornography and accused by a 17-year-old boy of solicitation to pose for nude photographs. He pleaded no contest to a charge of soliciting a minor, as the accuser was 14 when the offense first occurred. -MaeToMontreal
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112557/87309165/johnedwards.jpg">

9. Aaron Burr. He was Vice President of the United States when he shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. The duel killed Burr's political career—he was dropped from Thomas Jefferson's ticket in the 1804 election, and he couldn't even win an election for governor of New York. -gerhudire
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112616/87309171/rudy.jpg">

10. Henry VIII has to be up there. He was a famously handsome, pious, and noble young king, very in love with Katherine when they were married, and over time he became the wife-killing tyrant we know today. -SmunkTheLesser
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112603/87309167/philspector.jpg">

11. Charles Lindbergh deserves to be in the conversation. After making the historic first solo transatlantic flight, and gaining the sympathy of many after the kidnapping and murder of his son, he promoted American neutrality in WWII. Though he reversed his stance after the attack on Pearl Harbor, many had already branded him a Nazi sympathizer. -itto_02
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112606/87309168/ppetain.jpg">

12. John Edwards. Ran for VP, getting ready to run for Prez, find out he had an affair and a kid while his wife was dying of cancer. -imnotsoho
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112614/87309170/robespierre.jpg">

13. Rudy Giuliani. After the attacks of 9/11 he brought NYC together as mayor was on SNL and threw out the first pitch at Yankee stadium was really well liked by everyone. Then he was Trump's lawyer and held a press conference at the wrong four seasons and is seeing as a bumbling idiot yes man who does whatever trump wants. -hilldo75
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112512/87309156/chrisbenoit.jpg">

14. Phil Spector. The guy was a revolutionary music producer, creating the Wall of Sound formula. He produced music for some of the top musicians in the 60s and 70s and retired very young to his mansion in the Hollywood Hills.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112620/87309172/sambf.jpg">

In 2003 he murders actress Lana Clarkson, then spends the rest of his life in prison. I forgot he died in 2021. -steve-d
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/11/22/112627/87309173/oscarpist.jpg">

15. Philippe Pétain. French hero of WWI to Nazi collaborator of WWII. -doublestitch

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052131/87286529/bunk.png">

5. Staying home on a sick day.  As a kid it was a huge victory, got to stay in bed all day, watch TV, and having a parent tend to your every need. Then as an adult you're just thinking about the work you're gonna have to make up for and how you hope you don't need to go to a doctor. --eDgAR-

<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/12/052148/87286535/dew.png">

9. Getting mail. I remember everyday begging my parents if I got mail. (I had pen pals). I got so excited when something came for me. Now I dread going to the mailbox because all that will be there are bills. -Slowmechanic180

17. Summer. When you’re a kid, it's three months of freedom from school. When you’re an adult, you still have to go to work, but now it’s sweltering hot and you’re sweating your balls off all day, every day. -chadthundertalk

20. Twinkies. When I was a kid, they were the greatest things I've ever tasted. A couple of years ago I bought a package of two to share with my 10 year old, and neither of us got past a single bite. Those things are wretched. -doctor-rumack
