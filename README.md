## <a href="#link9" id="link8">19 Fascinating Pics Collected From History's Vault</a>
1. Grigori Rasputin, Russian mystic and spiritual advisor to the Romanovs and a highly influential figure in the court of Tsar Nicholas II.

Reportedly, Rasputin’s first assassination attempt occurred in 1914, when the prostitute Khioniya Guseva stabbed him in the gut with a dagger in what was thought to be a mortal wound. Eyewitnesses claim that as Rasputin’s entrails fell from his stomach Guseva shouted, “I’ve killed the antichrist.” Though Rasputin survived the attack, his demeanor changed permanently.
In 1916, the country’s distaste for Rasputin hit an all-time high, and a group of conspirators including Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yusupov set out to kill him. Using Yusupov’s wife to lure Rasputin to their home, the conspirators fed Rasputin wine and cakes laced with cyanide. Though it was reportedly enough poison to kill five men, Rasputin was unaffected.
Unperturbed, the conspirators continued their attack by beating him repeatedly, then shooting him in the back and causing him to fall to the floor. Yet Rasputin, much like antibiotic-resistant pathogen, still wasn’t dead. According to some, Rasputin jumped up violently, only to be shot several more times. The men then wrapped the body in a sheet or carpet and tossed him into the Neva River.
Rasputin’s body was pulled from the water three days later. Though autopsy reports differ, most attest that he was still alive when thrown into the water and that from the positioning of his body, he had tried to break free before either drowning or dying from hypothermia. The exact cause of death has been debated for decades.

3. Women protesting forced hijab days after the Iranian Revolution, 1979.

The date was March 8, International Women’s Day, and the image shows women from all walks of life — nurses, students, mothers — marching, smiling, arms raised in protest. More than 100,000 of them. At the time, Golestan recalls, Iranian people were very “politically charged” and believed change could be effected by demonstrating in the streets. “This time they were disappointed,” she says. “From the next day everybody had to wear the scarf.”

This was a test done for a Master’s thesis that involved children being presented with 2 dolls, 1 black 1 white. They asked the children which they would play with, which one is nicer/better, etc. The experiment showed a clear preference for the white doll. Some of the actual data is hard to find, but the work was accepted enough that the Supreme Court used it in Brown v Board of Education.

8. Muhammad Ali prevents a suicide 1981.

“Over the next few days, Ali spent over $2,000 getting the man clothes, an apartment and a job. The poor fellow broke down in tears. He couldn’t believe the heavyweight champion was helping him,” Bingham said.”
“He grasped Ali by the hands, tears running down his cheeks, and said: ‘I spent years alone after returning from Vietnam. ‘I became convinced that nobody cares whether I live or die, so I decided I would die – but you changed that for me. You have given me the strength to carry on,’” Bingham claimed.
Ali stayed in touch with the vet for years, Bingham said.
“The champ called him every few months. There’s no doubt that Ali saved his life and helped him get a new start,” he said.

So don’t feel sorry when you look at these pictures – feel angry that we need to be reminded of such folly. It is sad but necessary that these photographs exist.’

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">5 Sound Cloud Rappers Who Look Like Total Shit</a>
1. The first rapper on this list is known by his stage name, Stitches. Phillip Katsabanis, from Miami Florida, once looked like a skinny white kid, with a metal ball necklace and a new era hat, but he swapped out this timely look for something a little more permanent.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472258.jpg">

2. Not only did Stitches, tattoo stitches across his face but he also got a portrait of his firstborn child on his cheek. The Florida rapper is known for his hit song, "Brick In Yo Face" as well as his crazy tattoos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472259.jpg">

3. The second rapper on this list comes to us from Ronkonkoma, NY. Gustav Ahr, known as Lil Peep seems to have had an affinity for facial tattoos from a young age. There are very few images of the rapper before he altered his face with tattoos.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472253.jpg">

4. Lil Peep's look compared to the rest of the featured rapper is 'mild' to say the least. At least his forehead says baby instead of a gigantic 69 like our next entry.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472252.jpg">

5. Daniel Hernandez, known as  Teka$hi69 or just 6ix9nine, is probably the least known rapper on this list. Hernandez was born in Brooklyn, NY and may have one of the most shocking appearances of any rapper on this list. The Mexican American rapper has grown to recognition recently because his picture is the subject of a popular meme.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472255.jpg">

6. Here is 6ix9ine is all his SoundCloud candy glory. This dude must really love 69'ing!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472256.jpg">

7. XXXtentacion is the most notable rapper on this list. Jahseh Onfroy is from Boward County, Florida where he rose to fame during his time in prison. XXX is facing domestic assault charges that date back to over a year ago and just recently gave himself a makeover.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472254.jpg">

8. Here XXX looks like something out of the movie Alien. Though he may be shocking, his eyebrows will grow back and at least that's a tree on his forehead and not a giant dick.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472260.jpg">

9. Now, we did save the best for last. A transformation that will have your head in your hands and you asking why the hell at this point any of this nonsense surprises you. Boonk, aka John Robert Hill, is also a Florida rapper, (are you noticing a trend?) who rose to fame for his strange tattoos. Boonk isn't known for many hit songs or a large online following, but for his horrible choice of facial tattoos. Are you ready?  . .
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2404597/85472257.jpg">

10. Boonk, what were you thinking man? Oh, that's right you weren't, because no one with any sense in their brain would get such shitty tattoos on their face.
