## <a href="#link4" id="link3">25 Major Scandals Everyone Has Forgotten About</a>
1. Ticketmaster buying their own tickets to scalp out at thousands of dollars. -u/wpggloryhole
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265328.jpg">

2. Currently ongoing but nobody is saying sh*t. The Hyundai plant in Alabama has employed 50 underaged workers. Some of them are as young as 12 years old. They have these kids working shifts around the clock. Crazy that this hasn't made a.much bigger splash. -u/Ear_Enthusiast
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265329.png">

3. Those Turpin siblings that escaped being chained to their beds by their sh*tty parents? Happy ending, right? Yeah, no. Turns out their foster parents ended up abusing them even worse and now a bunch of them are suing. -u/TwoFingersWhiskey
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265330.jpg">

4. “Recycling.” You’d be amazed and disgusted at how much stuff you think you are recycling that your municipalities are shipping off to other countries just so they can dump it in the ocean for you. We know this is happening too but because we’re disconnected from it we just ignore it. -u/tibbymat
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265331.png">

5. Nurdles. Except it wasn't forgotten about, nobody cared to begin with. Nurdles are these tiny little plastic beads that companies buy as a raw material to melt down to make plastic products. If you were making plastic toys, you might buy bags of plastic "nurdles" to melt down for your molds. Anyway, some cargo containers FULL of these were lost from a ship and dumped into the Gulf Coast. It created an ecological microplastic disaster that is impossible to even attempt to clean up. Nobody really got into trouble for it. -u/sapphicsandwich
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265324.jpeg">

6. A lot of people seem to simply overlook the fact that Chris Brown beat the sh*t out of Rihanna. -u/amyjandrews
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265323.png">

7. The NYC Mayor's wife misplaced a whole lot of money and nobody seems to care. -u/irishpwr46
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265325.jpg">

8. Assassination of Haiti's president. -u/YesImThatGirl
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265326.jpg">

9. Not an overtly public or well-known scandal... but erm... where the f*ck is Shelly Miscavige? And why is no one actively investigating her disappearance? -u/JewJitsu83
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265327.jpg">

10. Wells Fargo bank opening BS accounts and submitting credit card applications on behalf of their customers....without their knowledge or consent. I'm actually a customer with them and have been for years so for all I know they did that to me, but all I ever got was a couple of emails about how they're really a good company with good people and that doesn't reflect their values or some such crap like that. I think they ended up firing a lot of people and executives who knew about it were fined millions of dollars. But I mean if the practice went that high it must have been widely known. -u/anfla56
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265332.png">

11. The FBI knew the pedophile Larry Nassar was molesting child gymnasts and allowed him to continue for years. They went so far as to falsify the testimony of the victims. No one at the FBI has been punished. Nassar was sentenced in 2017.-u/saw2239
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265322.png">

12. Airlines getting bailed out by taxpayers during a crisis and with executives still taking huge bonuses. The quality of airlines significantly deteriorated because they don’t want to compress profit by paying more to hire more and expand flight offerings again to pre-pandemic levels. -u/rpoh73189
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265333.jpg">

13. In 2016, South Korea had a political scandal in which president Park Geun-Hye was exposed for being manipulated/controlled by a cult called "The 8 Goddesses Cabal". South Korea was literally being ruled by a cult. Park was impeached. -u/YaBoyVolke
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265334.png">

14. MP Pedophile Dossier. A bunch of UK politicians were caught "borrowing" children for an orphanage for all the unspeakable things you can imagine. Another politician managed to weave himself into this circle consisting of around 20 members and took down names, dates, locations and victims. He then handed off this book to the Home Office (British CIA), who then handed it to the police, who then "lost" it. No action was taken. The case has been reopened 5 times since and each conclusion has always been "We lost the book. And we're not going to investigate it ourselves because uhh" . I think this circle is still going on and the police are being paid off to never investigate it. -u/WeakWraith
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265335.png">

15. Pilot truck stops stole around $250 million dollars from their customers. The owner was never really penalized for it and owns the Cleveland Browns. -u/cleach31
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265336.jpg">

16. Panama Papers. Proved that the rich and elite are hiding billions and everyone was just like 'meh'. -u/eddymarkwards
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265337.jpg">

17. Anne Sacoolas ran over a kid in the UK but got away with it because she was married to a US diplomat.-u/UrinalCake777
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265338.jpg">

18. Boy George!! He was jailed for 15 months for imprisoning a Norwegian male escort after a nude photoshoot, in what the judge called a "premeditated, callous and humiliating" assault. He basically tortured him. And now he hosts TV shows in Australia! -u/pushingnumbers
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265339.png">

19. That McDonald’s Monopoly sweepstakes? None of the big prize-winning pieces ever made it to stores. The guy in charge of ‘randomly’ putting them on cups and cartons after production kept them and gave them to friends, splitting the winnings. For YEARS. -u/AlwxWrites
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265340.jpg">

20. Dupont (still active company) when producing Teflon dumped loads of bad chemicals into the water and Teflon was poisoning people all over the world giving them 6 known types of cancer. They covered it up for decades. Crazy how evil some companies are. -u/Opposite-Mediocre
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265341.jpg">

21. In the Philippines, the dictatorship and the extra-judicial killings as well as the corruption under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos seemed to be forgotten already. People here even elected his son as the president. -u/pew_paooo
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265342.jpg">

22. The BP Oil Spill. In like, 2015 I drove by a packed BP and told my buddy "Wow BP is lucky everyone forgot" and he said, "Forgot what?" -u/mjzim9022
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265343.jpg">

23. Politicians cashing out for huge profits right before COVID was widely publicized and the stock market tanked. They made millions and millions as millions of people lost millions, and their lives. -u/tossaway69420lol
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265344.png">

24. Cambridge Analytica. They used social media and social sciences to manipulate entire countries. They helped facilitate Brexit and cause a huge cultural divide in the U.S. I think it’s a new kind of warfare. -u/SnapDragonBlues
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2559883/87265345.png">

25. The financial crash of 2008 and how all of the individuals responsible saw little to zero consequences of their actions which destroyed global economics. Allowing them to continue in their roles or similar who are now orchestrating new schemes that see the rich get richer and the working man more marginalized. -u/-TeddyDaniels
