## <a href="#link11" id="link10">11 Real Life Mysteries Even The X-files Team Couldn't Solve</a>
1. The Frog Boys.
In 1991, 5 South Korean boys between the ages of 9 and 13 inexplicably went missing after saying they were going out to catch frogs. A massive search went on, with over 300,000 police officers and volunteers looking for the boys. The parents even quit their jobs to focus on finding the kids. Eleven years later, a man was out in the woods looking for acorns when he came across the bodies of the boys. What was even more mysterious is that they were found in an area that was searched multiple times.
Initially, it looked as if they boys died of hypothermia, as they were pretty decomposed, but further investigation discovered that they were murdered. So far no suspects had been found and even if they did figure it out, the statute of limitations on murder expired in 2006 (15 years), so there’s nothing they can do and the case remains unsolved and super mysterious.

2. The Toxic Lady.
Gloria Ramirez was fighting an advanced case of cervical cancer in 1994, when she was rushed into the hospital suffering from confusion, irregular heart beat and trouble catching her breath. When nurses tried to sedate her to calm her down, they found that nothing was working. They decided to defibrillate her heart to get her normal rhythm back, when the noticed that she was covered in an oily sheen and her breath smelled like a fruity, garlic-y mix. As well, when they drew blood, it smelled like ammonia.
As soon as the blood was drawn, however, nurses started feeling nauseous and fainting and after 3 of them fainted, they evacuated the emergency room. Over 23 people became sick, and 5 were so bad that they had to be hospitalized. A special crew, in hazmat gear, went into the hospital to care for her, but Gloria soon succumbed to kidney failure. To date, no one knows what what it was about Gloria that made her so toxic and affected the hospital staff.

3. The Reincarnation of the Pollock Twins.
John Pollock and his wife Florence were the parents of two girls; 6-year old Jacqueline and 11-year old Joanna in England. In the spring of 1957, the Pollock girls were killed in a hit and run while walking to church. John and Florence prayed endlessly for more kids and a year later they were blessed with twin daughters – Gillian and Jennifer, and the couple insisted all throughout the pregnancy that the babies were going to be a reincarnation of their lost children.
As soon as they took a look at the newborns, they were proven right. They noticed some eerie similarities to their lost daughters. Jennifer had a white line across her forehead and a birthmark on her leg, the same as Jacqueline. When the girls were 3 months old, the family moved away. Four years later, they came back to their hometown and weird shit started happening. The toddlers recognized places they shouldn’t have and had memories they hadn’t experienced. There was even an incident where a car drove too close to them, and the girls freaked out saying the car was out to get them.

4. Skinwalker Ranch is a portal to nightmares.
Here’s a case where the name is already scary enough before you know what’s really going on. The name comes from a native tradition of a creature that looks can disguise itself as an animal for the purposes of tricking humans. In this case, this Utah ranch is known for its UFO sightings, poltergeist activity, floating orbs, portals to other worlds and unexplained phenomena.
Over the years, scientists, ghost hunters and writers have spent time on the ranch to learn the secrets, but so far have come up empty. Some say it’s because the land (like every horror movie trope) sits on Native ceremonial lands, or that the membrane between our world and other worlds is thin there, but ultimately, there’s no one, true answer.

5. Creepy Voice Inside the Car.
Usually road trips are full of excitement and joy, because you’re headed towards somewhere fun and sometimes the journey is just as awesome as the destination. Unless some ghostly shit happens; then it’s not so fun.
There’s a story that was making its rounds on the internet, about a road trip, where an 11-year-old girl was in a car with her aunt and friends, and they were following two cars. They were driving through an industrial area, when the first car made an unexpected turn, forcing the car in front of them and their driver to make a sharp dogleg down a side street.
In that moment, they heard a loud, clear voice in the car say “Sharp bend, hm?” Their driver immediately hit the brakes; the voice didn’t come from any of them. They noticed, at that time, that the other car in front of them had stopped as well. That driver got out with a scared face and asked them if they heard it too. Everyone heard the same thing. Two separate cars, two separate families, one clear voice in a deserted area.

6. The Chipotle Triangle.
Another story from the internet, a man and his girlfriend had a craving for Chipotle, so they headed to the nearby shopping area. When they pulled in at 5pm on a Friday evening, they found an empty parking lot. There were no tables set up outside, no cars in the parking spots and no lights on inside the building. Confused, he went to drive around the building in order to leave, thinking that it was closed, and they saw a firetruck parked alongside the building, with its headlights on, but no emergency lights and no-one near the truck. Coming around the building they saw something freaky.
By the time they made it back to the front of the building, they saw every parking spot was full, there were tables outside with patrons and all the lights were on, with people dining and doing takeout. As well, the firetruck was gone, as if it’d never been there.

7. The Kelly-Hopkinsville Encounter.
This is a strange alien encounter that somehow makes all the sense or no sense at all, depending on how you look at it. In 1955, a family of 5 adults and 7 kids rushed into the Hopkinsville police station in Kentucky, to report an alien invasion. They claimed that for the past few hours, they’d been battling 12-15 aliens on their property. All they saw were red eyes staring at them in the darkness, floating from tree to tree and that they were impenetrable by bullets.
Police were concerned that this was a prank, so they visited the property, only to find the expected bullet holes, but no other evidence. The next day, the police came back to follow up, only to find the family had fled in the middle of the night after another invasion, according to a neighbour.

8. The Man Who Ate Everything.
We all know someone who just happens to be able to eat anything and everything and not even gain a pound. In fact, they claim they never feel full. Turns out there’s someone who really had that condition. In the 18th century, there was a Frenchman by the name of “The Insatiable Tarrare.” According to historians, his hunger never ceased. He had a large mouth with stained teeth and he ate everything in sight, and no one knew why.
According to the stories, his belly was distended from eating so much, he sweated constantly and emitted an unbearable door. He’d swallow everything in his quest to feel full, including stones, baskets of fruit, and some even say live animals. He was staying in a military hospital at one point in his life, when a 14-month old went missing. It was suspected that he ate the child, as at the time they discovered the child missing, he was in the morgue, trying to eat dead bodies. After he was expelled from the hospital, he disappeared for a while, only to return 4 years later with tuberculosis and violent diarrhea that ultimately killed him. How and why he ate so much, remained a mystery.

9. The Hinterkaifeck Unsolved Murder.
Usually it’s the unsolved murders that are great inspiration for TV show plots, but this one takes the cake. In 1922, a German family was found murdered with their maid and no one knows how or why.
Days before the crime, the dad asked his neighbours if they knew why there was one set of footprints in the snow leading to his house. He then claimed that he heard footsteps in the attic and that a set of keys were missing. Finally, the maid that was killed was on her first day with the family, as the previous maid had quit on account of her believing the farm was haunted.
Even more eerie, is that while the evidence suggests that there might have been someone hiding there before the murder, there was stronger evidence that the perpetrator had actually stayed on the farm for a few days after killing the family. Then he disappeared. The murder remains unsolved.

10. The Overtoun Suicide Bridge.
Since the 50’s and 60’s, Overtoun Bridge has been the site of some mysterious dog deaths. There’s something about the bridge, that causes dogs to break away from their leashes and jump over the side, especially dogs with long snouts. In all cases, the weather had nothing to do with it, and it’s always in the same spot. Scientists and animal trainers have tried to figure out what it is about this particular bridge, but so far, no one has an idea.
Now, dogs are strongly forbidden, if not banned, on the bridge for the risk that they’d try to jump over and fall 50 feet to their death.

11. The Most Haunted Road in America.
This is supposedly the most haunted road in the US, based on the creepy shit that people have claimed have happened to them. Whether or not they’re verified, Clinton Road in NJ is the centre of a lot of urban myths and paranormal encounters.
This 10-mile long road of twists and turns has been long associated with ghosts, from rumours of a secret meeting place for Satanists, to a ghost of a boy who drowned decades before, to even ghost cars that chase motorists down the road. The most common ghostly apparition is of animals that stalk the forest and the road, and most claim it’s the ghosts of abused animals from the now closed “Jungle Habitat” park that used to be in the area. In any case, it’s a spooky stretch of road with a lot of scary shit.
