## <a href="#link3" id="link2">9 Craziest Things Doctors Removed From Patients</a>
1. Surgeons at Guanji Hospital, in Hezhou, China, recently spent six hours removing over 200 stones from a woman's gallbladder and liver, some of them the size of small eggs.

The patient, a 45-year-old known only as Ms. Chen, had apparently been experiencing abdominal pain for over a decade. When she first went to a hospital, an examination revealed several stones in her gallbladder and liver as the cause. Doctors advised her to undergo surgery and have them removed, but she was too scared to go under the knife. She only recently went to Guanji Hospital, when the pain became “unbearable.”

Dr. Quan Xuwei, one of the surgeons who operated, said that such a large number of stones was unusual, adding that it was probably caused by the woman's eating habits.

2. A 67-year-old woman has had 27 contact lenses removed from one eye. The discovery was made after the woman went to Solihull hospital in the West Midlands for routine cataract surgery.

In a report for the British Medical Journal (BMJ), experts from the hospital reported “a bluish foreign body” emerged during the procedure “as a hard mass of 17 contact lenses bound together by mucus." Ten more were found under further examination.

The experts wrote: “The patient had worn monthly disposable lenses for 35 years. She had poor vision in the right eye, and deep-set eyes, which might have contributed to the unusually large number of retained foreign bodies.”

Rupal Morjaria, a specialist trainee in ophthalmology, told Optometry Today: “None of us have ever seen this before. It was such a large mass. All the 17 contact lenses were stuck together. She was quite shocked. She thought her previous discomfort was just part of old age and dry eye."

3. In 2016, surgeons removed 40 metal knives from a patient who spent two months swallowing them, according to the doctor who led the operation. The unnamed 42-year-old man, who had an "uncontrollable urge" to eat the knives, went to a hospital in Gurdaspur in Northern India after complaining of stomach pain and weakness. Only after an ultrasound revealed a large mass in his stomach, did the man tell doctors he had swallowed knives.

Malhotra said they found folded knives, unfolded knives, and rusted and broken knives in the man's stomach. "I'm sorry I let my family down," the father of two said. “I'll be forever thankful to doctors and hospital staff for saving my life.”

4. A woman had to have mushrooms removed from her stomach by surgeons after they began to grow inside her. Doctors shared gruesome footage of the fungi lodged in the 50-year-old woman's gut, some of which had grown to up to 7cm long.

The mushrooms became stuck in the woman's stomach as she often reportedly ate cooked dry mushrooms directly without soaking them and didn't chew them properly. She went to the hospital after suffering from stomach ache, and doctors found that the mushrooms had expanded in her stomach and got stuck.

5. A man who put two live pond loaches into his anus went into intensive care after one of the fish swam up into his intestines. The unnamed 45-year-old man, who was drunk at the time of insertion, was rushed to hospital with signs of a high temperature, low blood pressure, and severe stomach pain.

According to reports, the man admitted to voluntarily putting two pond loaches into his anus when he was heavily under the influence of alcohol. Doctors in Guangzhou, southern China, managed to remove the fish successfully. One had broken through the bowel wall, which was causing the patient severe abdominal pain.

As the two loaches had stayed in the patient's body for over 24 hours, surgeons had to perform an abdominal digital radiography to locate them.

6. Doctors in Chennai, India successfully removed a cockroach from a woman's skull and—guess what, it was alive!

Selvi, a domestic worker living in Injambakkam, was fast asleep when she felt an insect crawling inside her nostril. She tried to brush it aside, but it had already gone in. She then went to the clinic where the doctors told her to visit Stanley Medical College Hospital. After the nasal endoscopy, the doctors found the cockroach sitting on the skull between her eyes. The doctors are glad that Selvi turned up at the right time because if the cockroach died, it might have harmed her brain.

7. A teenage girl is finally able to eat properly after doctors removed a hairball the size of a melon from her stomach. Aakansha Kumari had secretly been eating her hair for years, but her parents noticed something was wrong when her weight plummeted to just over two stone. So, doctors carried our an X-ray which revealed a huge mass that was taking up more than 80% of her stomach. 

Kumari was diagnosed with Rapunzel syndrome, a rare condition in which a hairball (called a trichobezoar) is found in the stomach, with its tail in the colon. Named after the Grimms fairy tale character, it is associated with trichotillomania, where sufferers have an irresistible urge to pull out one's hair, and trichophagia, the compulsive eating of hair.

8. A man lived almost 20 years with a plastic pen cap lodged in one of his lungs after he inhaled it as a child and forgot about it. Doctors found and removed the partially-dissolved cap after the man started coughing up blood and went to the hospital. When they showed it to him, he recalled accidentally inhaling the pointed object when he was a youngster in the 1990s.

He suffered fits of coughing throughout his childhood and early 20s but never thought that it was due to the pen cap. His symptoms have since been relieved following surgery.

9. A man in Vietnam was walking around for 18 years with evidence of a cutting-edge medical mistake, a pair of surgical scissors, stuck inside his body. 

In 2017, doctors removed the scissors from the abdomen of 54-year-old Ma Van Nhat. The tool was discovered during a routine medical check. The six-inch cutting tool was found on the left side of the belly, next to the colon and doctors said it was stuck to his organs.

Amazingly, Nhat rarely suffered pain, until recently. He was prescribed ulcer medications on occasion. He believes the scissors found their way into his body in 1998 when he had surgery at Bac Kan Hospital following a traffic crash. The hospital's director, Trinh Thi Luong, is now taking great pains to find out who may have left the scissors inside Nhat.

## <a href="#link10" id="link9">11 Viral Photos That Have Been Debunked as Fakes</a>
1. "What happened to a rainforest over the course of 10 years."
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894080.jpg">

2. This photo collage became a hit thanks to the popular #10YearChallenge. The picture is accompanied by text that says that every year, 46,000 to 58,000 square miles of forest are lost to deforestation. The photo looks real especially because of the logo in the right corner. But in fact, this is not a collage of 2 pictures taken 10 years apart, it is one picture from a photo stock. It shows Malasia where the rainforest was removed to increase the territory for growing palm trees.

3. A photographer captures a perfectly timed photo of a man cooking rice.

4. Well, it turns out the rice is actually fake. In fact, everything is fake. It’s simply a sculpture that you can buy in a shop in Tokyo.

5. A graffiti scene perfectly reflected in the water.

6. This photo became a hit on many websites. But the truth is, it was edited. Yes, this graffiti really exists and the building is located in Mariampol, Lithuania. And the author of the picture is a street artist named Ray Bartkus who drew the picture upside-down on purpose — for it to be reflected in the water. But the best time to see the picture is when there is no wind and the surface is perfectly smooth. Otherwise, the picture looks like this. See how the reflection in the first photograph was edited?

7. A lynx and a deer were found in an office under a table. They were hiding from fires in California.

8. “A fawn and a bobcat cub found under a desk in an office building after the California forest fire rolled through” is what the caption for the viral photo said on Reddit, Twitter, and other social media sites. Yes, the photo is real but it’s posted every time a forest fire breaks out somewhere in the US. And the caption is different every time. The picture was taken in May 2009 in a building that is owned by a non-commercial team of animal rescuers. During a fire in Santa Barbara, California, these cute animals were found not far from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s ranch. And because there were no cages, the fawn and the lynx had to be put in an office. The lynx just ran toward the deer and lied down next to it. By the way, one of the rescuers took the animals home because he was worried they would not survive in the wild. Later, he even shared a video with the grown-up lynx — he turned out to be very cute!

9. The New Year in Paris.

10. This popular picture shows hundreds of fireworks that were supposedly launched in Paris on New Year’s Eve. Unfortunately, the photo is fake and we found several pieces of evidence. First of all, on New Year’s Eve, the fireworks are launched from the Eiffel Tower. Secondly, all the fireworks in the photo are at the same distance from the camera. And finally, the Internet users who live in Paris claim that this is a fake picture. Just take a look at the picture of the real fireworks show above the Eiffel Tower on July 14.

11. A dog sleeping on the grave of its owner every night for 7 years.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894090.jpg">

12. Almost 60,000 likes and more than 55,000 shares were made by users when they saw the post about a dog that sleeps on a tombstone. The caption says that the dog named Captain has been visiting his owner’s grave for the last 7 years and sleeping there until morning. This photo is absolutely real and so is the story. The problem is, they’re not connected. For example, the same story was linked to a different dog sleeping on a grave as well.

13. A typical day in Russia”. You can see this photo with a similar title (for example, “Polar Express”) on the Internet. It is said that the photo shows a real white bear getting off the tram somewhere in Russia. You’d be surprised but the photo is absolutely real — it was taken in a town in the Czech Republic and it wasn’t edited. But the bear is not real — it’s a costume that 2 Greenpeace activists were wearing. This “bear” was a part of the campaign, Save the Arctic. It “walked” in European cities to attract attention to the problems in the Arctic.

14. A goose frozen to a pipe warmed a puppy with its wing. At the end of January, hundreds of thousands of people on social media liked and shared the photo of a shivering goose that froze to a pipe and was warming a puppy with its wings. Allegedly, they were found in Montana. Even though the photo seems to be real, it was taken a very long time ago and most likely, it wasn’t in the US. And on top of all that, the story itself is most likely a lie. These pictures have been shared on Chinese websites since 2017. The earliest post we were able to find was made in March 2017 on NetEase — it’s is a Chinese news platform. The text under these photos says that the puppy was sitting at the side of the road, freezing. Ducks were passing by and the puppy ran toward one of them and it covered it with its wing. NetEase actually allows users to post their own content. So that means that they give their own description to the photos and there is no way to find out if the photo is real or not.

15. A mountain shaped like a turtle’s head.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85894094.jpg">

16. In January 2019, Amazing Nature on Facebook posted a photo that shows a mountain that looks like a turtle. The post went viral but this mountain doesn’t actually exist — the photo was made by combining several pictures. For example, here are 2 of them.

17. A megalodon’s tooth in a whale vertebrae. The photo above shows fossils that look like a megalodon’s tooth and a whale’s bone but they were found in different places at different times. But one talented seller just combined them into one sculpture. This is what the owner of the artifact said about it. And if this were a real megalodon’s tooth stuck in a whale’s vertebrae, it would cost millions of dollars and would most likely be in an archaeological museum.By the way, this photo was first found online in 2012 and you could even buy the “artifact” for just $125.

18. A cruise ship dumping waste into the sea. The caption to this photo that was published on Facebook not long ago says that this cruise ship is dumping waste right into the sea. This post went viral and users started leaving bad comments and even the national director on the environment of Uruguay had to provide an explanation. In his Twitter account, he wrote that this photo shows the cruise ship starting its turbines in order to drop an anchor. And the brown spots are the sand and the sludge from the bottom.

1. Firstly both films take place on a mountain. Fair. Here's Arendelle and the Overlook Hotel, respectively.

2. Elsa is Jack Torrance. Alright, dangerous main characters. A threat to their family. Sure.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014720/87323356/jack.jpg">

3. Anna is Danny Torrance. Both are weird emo kids.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014700/87323337/door.jpg">

4. Play with toys on their own? I mean this is a stretch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014747/87323365/toys.jpg">

5. Both Anna and Danny have past injuries thanks to their family members. I can promise you, some things really are just coincidence.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014712/87323346/bike.jpg">

6. The fact that these two are just goofy as hell, doesn't mean there is any other correlation.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014750/87323366/wendy.jpg">

7. Kristoff and Sven are Dick Hallorann and his snowcat.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014723/87323360/kristoff.jpg">

8. Sven is a literal reindeer and a snowcat is a vehicle, but sure I guess I'll allow it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014704/87323340/dick.jpg">

9. For this theory to work we have to imagine Elsa hitting Kristoff with an axe.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014717/87323354/hands.jpg">

10. I'm not saying there aren't eerie similarities...
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014734/87323362/stairs.jpg">

11. But comparing Elsa's ice palace to the Gold Ballroom at the Overlook just isn't it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014726/87323361/magic.jpg">

12. Hans is Grady. Basically death and family and murder. Another stretch.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014716/87323350/grady.jpg">

13. The escapes seem to fit the narrative. Both Danny and Anna leave through a window down an icy slope.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014754/87323367/window.jpg">

14. This one might be the only piece for me that holds any water.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/12/22/014746/87323364/slide.jpg">

15. But alas, Elsa sacrifices herself to save her sister. While Jack freezes to death after trying to murder his kid with an axe. I think we can call this one debunked.
