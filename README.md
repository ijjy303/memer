<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/1044414/85337870.jpg">

1. People in Siberia, Russia line up for bread in 1990. This was the norm throughout most of the USSRs history, but people were usually fed post WWII. Unfortunately, as the USSR was collapsing, it got worse and people waited for hours for basic groceries or supplies and wouldn't get what they were in line to get in the first place for days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2104182/85435445.jpg">

4. The MS St. Louis when it arrived in Antwerp in 1939. This was a German ocean liner carrying around 900 Jewish refugees. The German captain and his crew got them out of Germany. They first tried to seek asylum in Cuba, but were denied. Then they tried the US and Canada, but both denied them as well. Luckily Belgium, The Netherlands, France and the UK accepted them. However, since 3 of those countries were conquered by the Nazi's, over a quarter of these Jews were shipped to camps and died.
