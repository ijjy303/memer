## <a href="#link5" id="link4">18 Crazy Things Found By Hotel Room Service</a>
1. I had a checkout where someone left behind their false teeth. They never came back for them.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314053.jpg">

2. I no longer work the job, but when I did I thought I found a dead body because I saw a person in bed under the covers after checkout. I called out but got no response. Guy forgot his inflatable girlfriend under the covers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314041.jpg">

3. I remember going into a room and it STANK, soon found the source, 3 dirty nappies floating in a bathtub. That is disgusting but unfortunately not completely abnormal. What was weird was the sight of an untouched large fish from one of the fish&chip shops tucked up in the double bed like a small child. Definitely a memory.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314043.jpg">

4. Bees and bee crap literally covering every single spot in the place. The guy was a beekeeper and was delivering a hive. He brought it into the room, where the hive tipped over and broke. It took days of scrubbing with some harsh chemicals to get the poo off. Even had to repaint walls.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314044.jpg">

5. A hole cut in a mattress because the "platinum level" guest s**t the bed drunk and then used a butter knife to cut it out and flip the mattress over.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314045.jpg">

6. Blood, lots of blood. Literally on everything. Me, and the person cleaning with me, got out of there and reported it. Customer had gotten extremely drunk and sliced his hand open, then freaked. Also found various weapons and one time a raccoon trap. This was my first job, in high school.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314046.jpg">

7. A giant ring of salt on the carpet like straight out of Supernatural.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314048.jpg">

8. I worked at a mountain/ski resort the first year it opened. There was a big snowfall in mid-November and suddenly we were fully booked for the Thanksgiving weekend. Management didn't hire any extra cleaning staff, so it took us almost the rest of the next week to work our way through all the rooms and suites. You would not believe how many people had left half-eaten turkey carcasses, not in the refrigerator, or in the trash, but just sitting out on the counter.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314050.jpg">

9. A pile of human skin, on the floor beside the bed. It was like sunburned skin peelings or something. Truly disgusting.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314047.jpg">

10. Teams I've been on have found: A dildo stuck to a mirror, butt plug in pull out couch, (poor girl picked it up cause it looked like a ring pop), and used condoms both more than a couple times.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314051.jpg">

11. This guest left his mom, an elderly disabled woman, in her room for 2 days. She was unclothed, with a colonoscopy bag and catheter bag full to the max. This woman had not eaten in 2 days and could have died if we did not do a life and safety check when the bill was not paid for a 1 nighter. We eventually located her son, who tried to dump her in the hotel so he could go on a bender.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314042.jpg">

12. A dead elk on a tarp during hunting season.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314052.jpg">

13. 5 pairs of Yeezys. He traveled alone.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314059.jpg">

14. We had a guy stay in the hotel who was in town for a competitive eating contest. When he checked out, he s**t all over the bed. Like ALLL over. I think he wiped his a*s with the sheets. We threw everything away.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314054.jpg">

15. S**t stains on the lampshade. I just spun it around so the stains faced the wall.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314055.jpg">

16. Broccoli and spinach in the shower on two separate occasions. THREE jars of mustard on the bedside table.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314056.jpg">

17. Was cleaning a room and opened up the nightstand drawer, and found a fire alarm in a sandwich bag, along with the batteries. It was the one that went with the room, on the ceiling. The ceiling was very tall, it couldn't be reached even by a reasonably tall man standing on the bed, and they had to grab one of the tallest ladders to put it back on. We have no idea how the man reached this, or if he brought in a ladder to do so, nor do we know why. He never spoke to the front desk about it.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/87314057.jpg">

18. I used to be a housekeeper back in my youth to pay for college. I'd say for my weirdest was when I saw these three cowboy dudes come out of a room around checkout. I head in to clean it up and there were beer cans and bottles on every available surface but the floor. Weirdest part though, room smelled completely normal and was fairly clean. Not a single indication that the beer was drank there.
