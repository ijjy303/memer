## <a href="#link4" id="link3">The Weirdest Tattoo-Related Offers People Actually Accepted</a>
1. Cafe 51, a favorite burger joint in Melbourne, Australia, is offering anyone the chance to receive a free burger a day for the rest of their lives, if they get a scale tattoo of one of their delicious burgers, anywhere on their body.


Cafe 51 plans to take registrations all through October. Considering all the media attention the campaign is getting, the number of applicants will probably reach into the tens of thousands.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155965.jpg">

2. Get scarred for life for a little extra cash! That's the tempting offer floated by New York City's Rapid Realty, which is offering employees 15% raises if they get the company's logo tattooed on their person. Some 40 employees have already done so — either because they love the firm, need the money, or both. 

There are no size or placement restrictions — one apparently ashamed employee got a small tattoo behind her ear — and the design isn't terrible. Rapid Realty owner Anthony Lolli pays for the tattoos, which cost up to $300 each. But he has yet to get one himself.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155966.jpg">

3. Scott Campbell, a well-known tattoo artist, based in Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, has created the ultimate test of trust in his work —  he offers free tattoos to people as long as he gets to choose the design and not show it to them until it's done. The name of his project is “Whole Glory.”

The trust these people place in him when they stick their hands through the wall for a free tattoo isn't unfounded — Campbell has tattooed celebs like Marc Jacobs, Orlando Bloom, and Penelope Cruz. Nonetheless, he does thank each person for their trust in him and his art.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155967.jpg">

4. 
Andreas Mueller won a silver Mini Cooper by pulling off a crazy stunt during a radio show contest — he got a tattoo of the word "mini" on his penis. Listeners heard Muller shriek as he received the tat on his man part while a female host watched. "Once I'm sitting in the car, it won't matter anymore," said Mueller, 39.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155968.jpg">

5. Grant Burton wanted to get his parents something special for their 40th wedding anniversary, but he was unemployed and didn't have much cash to spare. Knowing his parents always wanted to go to Europe, Grant contacted EuRail and asked them if they would give him two passes if he did something crazy to promote their brand.

 He offered to have their logo and website permanently tattooed on his back. Amazingly, they said yes. Now Grant has to get used to telling this story every time he takes his shirt off.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155969.jpg">

6. After hearing that a business owner in New Hampshire was giving customers free Trump tattoos, a Vermont tattoo parlor began offering free tats of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. 

Initially, the deal from Aartistic Inc. in Winooski came with a catch— customers could only get a free tattoo of Sanders if they were using it to cover up a Trump tattoo. The offer has since been extended to any pro-Sanders ink, parlor owner Tyre Duvernay claimed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155970.jpg">

7. The manager of Pascha, which houses more than 120 prostitutes, did not expect any takers when he put up posters advertising the tongue-in-cheek promotion.

 But more than 40 men have already come forward to have the brothel's name tattooed on their arms in large blue letters, and the tattoo artist even has to work extra shifts to keep up with demand.

Men who have the tattoo will skip the brothel's €5 entry fee for life and get discounts on other services like lap dances. (They'll still have to pay for their time with the prostitutes who are self-employed and independent from the brothel.)
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155971.jpg">

8. As part of its annual customer appreciation party in 2014, the Pi Pizza food truck offered its most fanatical fans free pizza if they agreed to get a pizza-themed tattoo permanently etched onto their skin.

The year before,  fans of Calleo's Pizza could get a pizza-related tattoo In return for a free slice a day,  each day that his truck was open.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85155972.jpg">

9. A York St. John student has bagged himself a year's free entry to all C9 club nights simply by getting a tattoo.  The unidentified clubber got the logo of events company Crowd 9 tattooed on his bottom and will be able to keep his money in his pocket on nights out this year.

## <a href="#link8" id="link7">Man Pays $3,000 DMV Tax Bill With 300,000 Pennies!</a>
1. After months of frustration with the DMV, Nick Stafford had finally had enough and chose a weighty way to express himself: thousands and thousands of pennies.
He delivered the $2,987.14 he owed in taxes in five wheelbarrows weighing a combined 1,548 pounds. It took employees more than 12 hours to count them by hand after the DMV's coin counting machines broke.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85240811.jpg">

2. These pennies were not from heaven as much as from Nick's petty, spiteful soul. His frustration started when he tried to find out where to register a new car. He has four houses across two counties, so he needed to contact someone to get a straight answer, which took a lot of work.
After his call was routed to a call center, where he spent an hour on hold before giving up, he filed a Freedom of Information Act request for a direct line. Even then he had to call repeatedly to get his question answered.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85240812.jpg">

3. After that, he was incensed – and motivated. “If they were going to inconvenience me then I was going to inconvenience them,” he said. So Nick filed three lawsuits, one of which requested direct phone numbers to nine other local DMVs that his local DMV employees refused to provide.
His lawsuits were dismissed when the state handed over a list of the phone numbers in court
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/202553/85240813.jpg">

4. Of course, he wasn't quite done proving his point. There was still the matter of almost $3,000 in taxes on his cars. Nick's act of defiance didn't come cheap. He had to hire 11 people to break open rolls of pennies with a hammer, paying them $10 an hour.
Between that, $400 in wheelbarrows, and $165 to file the lawsuits, he spent $1005 on his stunt.
