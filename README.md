## <a href="#link7" id="link6">Couple Moves Into An Older Home And Find A Fallout Shelter</a>
1. When  Colleen and Chris Otcasek bought a new home in Woodland Hills, they had no idea that their new home held a pretty awesome secret. I mean, it had the usual features that you look for in a home; great kitchen large bedrooms, a huge backyard…With the except of their very own FALLOUT SHELTER!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258282.jpg">

2. The real estate agent told them that the lot had a pretty ‘unusual feature’ in the back yard; a large, concrete-lined hole. They were told that the hole used to lead to a fallout shelter from the Cold War Era, but in all honesty, no one had gone down there all this time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258283.jpg">

3. One day, they were feeling brave, so they invited someone from the local radio station and went down the rusted ladder and found an old door at the bottom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258284.jpg">

4. Inside they found a small fallout shelter, large enough for a family of four, full of everything you’d need to survive a nuclear attack. The bunker contained water, canned food, clothing, and medicine, as well as magazines and books. Everything was still pristine and vintage.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258285.jpg">

5. So wondering who’d be the type of person to build a fallout shelter in the middle of a valley outside of Los Angeles, so they did a little research and contacted the media. While building a fallout shelter during the cold war was a common practice, to find one like this one, it must have had a pretty interesting story.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258286.jpg">

6. Soon they got a hit from Debrah Kaufman, who visited the couple at the house and told the couple that her father Alvin, was the one to build the shelter, back in 1961. He figured, if he built it 15 feet below ground, it would be safe enough for his family.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258287.jpg">

7. Alvin Kaufman was a self-taught nuclear engineer working as a contractor for a few companies, testing the effects of nuclear war on industry and of course, what it would do to humans. Knowing firsthand what the effects were, he wanted to do something to keep his family safe.The irony, though, is that he approached everyone in his cul-de-sac and offered to build one big enough for everyone. They said no. So he just made one for himself and his family, filled with several sleeping areas, a water tank, a hand cranked air filter and enough food to last several weeks.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258288.png">

8. The shelves were full of  food from the era, all still sealed.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258289.jpg">

9. This is probably the most important thing for a fallout shelter, coffee. Although this can has seen better days.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258290.jpg">

10. Multi-Purpose food, was a powdered protein mix that was created by a California inventor, by the name of Clifford E. Clinton and his biochemist friend Dr. Henry Borsook in 1946. The MPF was meant to provide proper nutrition at a very affordable price.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258291.jpg">

11. A few board games to help pass the time.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258301.png">

12. Food storage options, of course.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258292.jpg">

13. No shelter is complete with out plenty of tissue and toilet paper!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258293.jpg">

14. Just in case you want to play some post-nuclear Beer Pong!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258294.jpg">

15. Plenty of clothing so you can keep your sense of style in the post-apocalyptic world.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258295.jpg">

16. First Aid kit, with various powders and ointments. This was a common thing to find in Cold War Era fallout shelters.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258296.jpg">

17. Medications.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258297.jpg">

18. They also found many editions of the Analog Science Fiction and Fact Magazine, full of stories from the major Sci-Fi writers of the day. Definitely a must read when you’re trapped in a small cube with the rest of the world destroyed!
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258298.jpg">

19. Deborah also shared some items that she took from the shelter when she sold to the Otcaseks, including some of her dad’s books on Nuclear fallout.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258299.png">

20. Kaufman, who died in 2004, was a pragmatist to wanted to make sure he was prepared for everything and these books were important to him.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/604025/85258300.png">

21. The couple plans to leave the shelter as it is for the next homeowners to find as a surprise.

1. Alex Jones, for obvious reasons. -Comet127
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040605/87289276/alexjones.jpg">

2. Chris Brown. A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled the vehicle over on an unknown street, reached over Robyn F. (Rihanna) with his right hand, opened the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040608/87289277/chrisbrown.jpg">

Robyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F.'s mouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. -Steepanddeep
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040613/87289278/beyonce.jpg">

3. As you know, she named her first child Blue Ivy. There was a Boston-based company that had had that name prior to her naming her child that. She tried to trademark the name, and I think attempted to sue the company; the company won because they had been established for at least a few years at that point.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040614/87289279/dannymasterson.jpg">

Also, when she gave birth, the whole maternity ward was closed off to everyone. Including fathers whose partners had just given birth. Imagine your wife giving birth and you’re not allowed to be there because a celebrity wants the whole floor to herself. -mistressglass

4. No one else can't stand Danny Masterson? Rapist protected by a cult? Ruined that show for me, what a POS. -VERO2020
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040626/87289281/jaredfogle.jpg">

5. I just don't understand how Johnny Depp got booted from 'Fantastic Beasts' off of one allegation when Ezra miller has been arrested for things and is just dubious generally and he's still in those movies. -blayndle

9. Anyone who uses their celebrity platform to promote medical decisions they have no authority or intellect to promote. Jenny McCarthy I am looking at you and all your anti-axxer friends. -Forward-Driver-3676

I don’t think he’s at all funny, which isn’t why I dislike him. He’s extremely pretentious, seems to think he’s God's gift to comedy. Hes' been very rude in a lot of interviews, especially his with Larry King. Jerry seems like the kind of guy I would hate to meet. -commando_cookie0

11. All of the Duggars, but especially Josh for molesting his sisters and cheating on his wife all while espousing wholesome Christian values. He can f**k right off.

Edit: And kiddie p*rn. Massive omission and the biggest offense of them all! I subconsciously tried to forget that one, I guess. -Due-Bed-4669

12. Kim Kardashian. She’s my pick. Not just because I hate everything she stands for, everything she has generated, everything she has influenced, and the poison she unleashed on a whole generation or two of mainly women, but also because she gets treated as some kind of luminary and hero of something something women.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/2022/10/17/040659/87289291/lena.png">

She’s constantly the main interview in women power summits, and I’ve so many people filled with pride proclaiming her as “the most powerful business woman in the world” as of that makes her any less of a piece of poisonous shit or her business do anything even remotely constructive to society - in fact it’s just the opposite. Goddam I hate that whole quadrant of American celebrity. -nsinsinsi

13. Kanye West. Literally, he was abusive, practically stalking Kim K and using threatening language and the world just found it entertaining??? Disgusting. -Loveisapill

14. Dr. Phil likely knew about abuse going on at a turnaround camp he was sending kids to and then belittled Danielle Bregoli (cash me ousside girl) after she shared her experiences with being at one. -picnic-boy

## <a href="#link9" id="link8">12 Character Deaths That Ruined Popular Television Shows</a>
1. Marissa – The OC...The OC was facing declining ratings and quality and decided to mix it up and have one of their main characters, Marissa Cooper, die in a terrible car accident. But the real victim of that fatal car accident was the show itself, which never recovered and was put out of its misery shortly after.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196545.jpg">

2. Lexa and Lincoln - The 100...The 100 started out as a show about space kids who came down to Earth, but after we discovered that there were humans still alive on the ground, the Grounders quickly became the most interesting part of the show. But the writers clearly hadn’t figured that out when they killed off two of the most compelling characters — Lexa and Lincoln — in really disappointing ways. Lexa was felled by a stray bullet and Lincoln was shot in the head unceremoniously by someone who got killed himself shortly after. Many fans have sworn not to watch the show's upcoming fourth season, but whether or not The 100 is ruined for good remains to be seen.

3. Curtis – Misfits...When Curtis died, all the original characters had left the show, and the audience was expected to care about an entirely new cast. While the writing on the show remained good, it’s pretty hard to convince audiences to stick with a show after all the original main characters are gone. We didn’t just care about ANY misfits, you know? We wanted OUR misfits.

4. Rita Bennett – Dexter...Rita was the balance to Dexter’s character, the person who (unintentionally) supplied cover for his murderous ways, and also inspired him to be a better person. Without her, the show struggled to find the balance that had made it so appealing in earlier seasons. I heard that the last season of Dexter got good again but I honestly don’t know because I gave up on it the second Colin Hanks was wrangling snakes or whatever
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196548.jpg">

5. McDreamy – Grey’s Anatomy...Grey’s Anatomy is famous for killing off major characters in totally ridiculous ways. A lot of people thought the show lost its way after the plane crash that killed off Lexie Grey and McSteamy (and Arizona’s leg, and Arizona and Callie’s marriage). But the last straw might have been McDreamy kicking it because of a surgical mistake after a car accident. What the crap.

6. Tara- Buffy...The reactions to Tara’s death was mixed — some people liked the path it sent Willow down, while others were upset that half of primetime network TV’s first lesbian couple was offed by a stray bullet. Tara was a fan favorite and many viewers stopped watching after her death — Buffy’s final season fell in the ratings from 4.4 million to 3.8 million viewers.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196550.jpg">

7. Fox Mulder – The X-Files...While they didn’t exactly kill off Mulder permanently, his weird treatment in the last few seasons dulled the appeal of the show. The X-Files was all about Mulder AND Scully and the way they played off each other. Without that chemistry, the show lost its footing
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196551.png">

8. Charlie – Two and a Half Men...When Charlie Sheen lost his mind very publicly, he was killed off of his own show and replaced by Ashton Kutcher. Killing off a major character is always a bold move, but especially in a comedy. Replacing Sheen with Kutcher did add to some renewed interest in the show, but without two of the original three main characters (Angus T. Young converted to Christianity and decided the show went against his morals), Two and a Half Men basically became a spin-off of itself. It lasted two more seasons before being canceled, so I guess the question is which version of the show did you like better?
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196552.jpg">

9. Laurel – Arrow...Laurel Lance started out as a badass, independent woman. She died in recovery after surviving surgery and didn’t even have time to say goodbye to her dad. People were pretty freaking pissed that she was all "I’m glad you found happiness, it’s okay you don’t love me but I love you" right before she kicked it. Not a befitting ending for a strong woman, and her death turned Arrow into The Felicity Show. Ratings dropped off in the episodes after Laurel’s death because we didn’t sign up to watch the dang Felicity Show.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196553.png">

10. Curtis – 24...How are there two Curtises on this list?! Jack Bauer shot his pal Curtis in the head because Curtis kidnapped a bad dude. Because Jack Bauer has never kidnapped a bad dude?! Or murdered someone?! Weird change in morals. This felt like a gratuitous death of a major character that just pissed people off. It didn’t need to happen, it was just a ratings grab and a disrespectful end for a well-liked character. Boo. We expected 24 to stick to what it did best — advocating torture and depicting a world where nobody eats, sleeps, or goes to the bathroom.
<img src="https://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/2183782/85196554.jpg">

11. Glenn – The Walking Dead?While this death only happened a couple weeks ago and we don’t know what the show will be like without him, a lot of fans are pissed as hell that Glenn will no longer be on the show. Yeah, we know Negan killed him in the comics in the same way he was offed on the show, but the show has diverted from the comics before. And his eye popping out? God damn. That was truly awful, even for a show full of death, misery, and gore. There are so few season one characters still alive and Glenn was one of the most relatable. F*ck. I’m sad now.
